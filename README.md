# Setting up for contribution
## Beginner questionnaire:
1. Have you used git/github before?
2. Are you familiar with Markdown at all?
	1. Reference Markdown cheat sheet for obsidian
3. By any chance are you familiar with note taking in obsidian?

## Setup steps
### Git Setup
1. Install github desktop (and git if need be separately? Should bundle.)
2. Make a github account.
3. Sign in to github desktop
4. Clone my public repository
5. I might need gitLFS as well!
	1. I should double check if I have it configured for this repo or not...
### Obsidian setup
1. Install Obsidian
2. Open the cloned directory with obsidian as a vault
	1. Do they need to install the plugins and whatnot themselves ahead of time to get it to match/sync up properly?
	2. Or will it just automatically download them and whatnot?
4. Ensure everything you write is in the ***content*** directory please.
	1. Otherwise it won't be included in the website upon pushing updates.
	2. I'll also need to ensure the vault ignore files are set up properly for the config, so it doesn't pick up all the extra generated html/htmx within obsidian.
		1. Test via Graph view!
