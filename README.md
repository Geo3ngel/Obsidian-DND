# Setting up for contribution
## Beginner questionnaire:
1. Have you used git/github before?
2. Are you familiar with Markdown at all?
	1. Reference Markdown cheat sheet for obsidian
3. By any chance are you familiar with note taking in obsidian?

## Setup steps
### Git Setup
1. Install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
2. Make a github account or [login](https://github.com/login) if you don't have one already.
3. Sign in to github desktop with github account
4. Clone my [public repository](https://github.com/Geo3ngel/Obsidian-DND)
```
https://github.com/Geo3ngel/Obsidian-DND.git
```
> [!TODO] Add some bit here about how to use `github desktop`
> Pull, Commit, Push.
> Maybe discuss branching as well?
> - probably better to use that time for mentioning merge conflicts.
### Obsidian setup
1. Download and Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)
2. Open the cloned directory with obsidian as a vault
	1. Open obsidian
	2. Open folder as vault
	3. Select the cloned repository directory
> [!error] Ensure vault config is working!
> 1. Are obsidian's ignore files are working? Ensure the vault ignore files are set up properly for the config, so it doesn't pick up all the extra generated `html/htmx` within obsidian. Test via Graph view to see if it includes html files and what not.
> 2. Are plugins loading/happy?
> 	- There might be some setting we need to tweak manually upon setup.
> 	- Have Hunter or someone be the guinea pig for this
