# Items I'd like to obtain:
Plate Armor! (+2 more AC!)

Future Upgrade Considerations:
More Strength is always nice, but I shouldn't Neglect my Charisma for Aura of Protection!
- Everyone within 10ft/30ft (depends on level) gains a benefit against saving throws based on my modifier!
	- Level 18 for 30ft
- Cleansing Touch is also reliant on my Charisma Modifier! (level 14)

# Level 4 upgrade considerations!
I get to choose between a feat or 2 stat improvements!

Either +1 for +4 STR modifier, or a feat:

I've considered my options, and I think for level 4 I either need to go for the strength modifier buff, or Shield Master.

**Shield Master** does require I use my reaction though to block all incoming damage, and it does require I succeed the dex saving throw, which adding my shield, I only get a +3 to... so pretty conditional, at least until I get an enchanted shield or something.
- Also locks me into using shields long term.
It sounds like there might be some shield ITEMS that provide the same effect as Shield master, so probably should avoid this actually in favor of stat increases + Extra tricks...

So for level 4, I'll be going with +2 to my STR modifier!
## For Feats, I'd like to consider:

- Gift of the Metallic Dragon
	- Grants me cure wounds (can use once without expending a spell slot)
		- Eh, this would mean I burn more spell slots, which I need for SMITING!
	- Protective Wings to shield myself or another creature as my reaction!
		- Grants a bonus to their AC equal to my proficiency bonus against that attack roll!
		- Can be used as many times as I have proficiency bonus!
			- what is my proficiency bonus? 2. It'll be 3 at level 5!
			- So I can then have a AC of 2 twice per long rest!

- Gift of the Gem Dragon
	- Increases Int/Wis/Cha by 1 (pick one)
	- Telekinetic Reprisal
		- If I take damage from a creature within 10 feet of me, I can use my reaction to emanate telekinetic energy.
			- Creature then has to make a strength saving throw (8+prof+ability modifier)
			- IF they fail the save, they take 2d8 force damage and are pushed up to 10 feet away
			- On a succeed, they take half damage and aren't pushed
			- Usage of this ability is limited to my proficiency bonus (refreshed on long rest)
	- Kind of sucks I think? Would rather take more strength, right?

Rune shaper could be neat, it allows me access to a large list of useful spells!
- doesn't fit Waron though.

The Scion ones could be funny.
Imagine I go with "The Outlands", I could flavor Waron's Psychic damage resistance as him being to stupid to be impacted by psychic attacks.
- Mage hand would be cool to have too I guess

### Aberrant Dragon mark could be cool to flavor some of Waron's Scars!
+1 to Con (Useless actually)
1 Sorcerer cantrip & lvl 1 spell!
- Can cast the lvl 1 spell for free through the mark once!

-> The Flaws associated with this sound like so much fun!
	-> Mood swings any time I use the mark are a great flaw!

-> Would need to ask hunter about the Greater Aberrant Powers Option
I'd hope for the boon of Fortitude!
- would cancel out the negative effect!
- Or boon of invincibility sounds life saving!
- Magic Resistance would also be good!

A lot of these would be fun!

Eldritch adept:
- Beast Speech, for endless speaking with animals (Waron is a beast, so it fits)


If I want to be a power gamer, I could go Fey Touched:
+1 Wisdom
Take Hex as my spell of choice, since I can effectively make 3 hits per turn.
- additional d6 necrotic dmg!
Wait, **Hunters Mark** is literally just a better hex! 

**Mobile** could be incredible for hit and run tactics!
- I poke em' with my scythe, 
Resilient isn't bad, but Id rather take skill points tbh.

> [!error] ### SHIELD MASTER?!
> allows me to shove with my shield (bonus action)
> Add shield's AC to dex throws against harmful spells & effects
> If I succeed a dex throw for an attack that would normally only halve the damage, I take no damage.

## I should really just look ahead at what I WILL get, so I can plan out what I'd like my build to be...
Considering my lvl 6 benefits from Charisma more, I should probably increase my charisma by 1 to 14 if I can!

> [!error] ### Strike of the Giants are REALLY good!
> I can do an extra 1d10 fire damage each turn if I wish!
> Hill Strike can make them prone! This shit's busted!
> 	- This is busted for attacking ranged/wizard characters w/ low STR!
> 	- I can mark & teleport to them, prone them, and wail away!
> 
> 	The saving throw is only 8 + Prof + STR though! 
> 	- That'd be 13 for me right now, at max PROF, that'd be 14 before adding my STR! (17)
> 		- If I max STR for +5, they need to make a 21 saving throw! LMFAO!!!
> 	
> NOTE: This only applies against "Creatures". (what are considered creatures?)
> - ALL THINGS ARE CREATURES! EVEN CONSTRUCTS LMAO!
> -
> ### Never mind:
> You can use this feat a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
> - Still good, just not broken.



### After level 4, I have 4 remaining opportunities to increase my ability score or pick a feat.
- Do I really want a feat right now? Or more Strength/Con?
- I'll definitely want to increase my Charisma at some point, looking at my later abilities.
- Can I gain more spell slots from a feat for more smites?
	- This would really up my burst damage potential!
I could take a feat that increases my STR by 1, and avoid the feat later to add to STR & WIS
