Surprisingly Waron opens up about feeling like a failure after the day/nights proceedings.

Likely the equivalent of a wedding ring\nVerena and Cello\nVerena asks Cello a few questions about the box, having not seen it before at the pub\nShe nat 20s, and identifies the unique spell locking the box.\n\nThere’s a contingency spell placed on it? (Contingency being the spell name)\n\nRequires something specific to happen for the box to open\n\nMaybe it requires a specific song to be played to open?\nThe inscription reads: “To my princess in the moonlight, finish what I could not.”\n\nAlludes to a song? Verse? Vengeance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCello plays the song “The moonlight princess” to the box, rolls a 22.\n\nFucking NAILS it.\nNoOnesThereToAupplause.jpeg\nBox does not open\n\n\nReferences"},"Hunter---Luyarnha-Campaign/Session-Notes/Video-Editing/DND-Session-Video-Editing":{"title":"DND Session Video Editing","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The General template to get my audio to match up with my current hardware setup:\nHardware list\n\n\n                  \n                  TODO \n                  \n                \nSet this up based on the object template system I want to add!\nSo for future audio setups, I know to tweak/use a different config!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio\nIn Fair light Audio, Click on Dynamics, enable it, and set the Threshold to -22db and range to 18.\nI wonder if there is a good way to do “Templates” in Davinci resolve, so I can smack in a video, and have it get a set of features applied to it, for consistent audio etc.\n\nIf not, I could always do something like this via python scripts!\n\nFairlight Audio presets?\nThis seems like the way to go!\n\nReferences\nFairlight Audio presets"},"README":{"title":"README","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"George’s Compendium of DND Notes\nCurrently the only entry here is for Hunter’s Steinhardt’s guide to the eldritch hunt campaign.\nThis is a sub repo that restricts sensitive character info docs via gitignore\nSo this repo can be the source of published information for things like Session notes, NPCs, Locations, etc.\nFeatures I’d like to add:\n\n(COMPLETED) Ability to blacklist/white list files/directories that display on the blog/website\n\nThis can be achieved via git ignore\n\n\nrecognition of obsidian hyper links?\n1.\nwould be ideal if I could just embed obsidian with plugins as the website for the other addons I have like properties and whatnot\n\nI could just leave properties invisible and allow someone to search by the tag property though if I do it custom!\nMaybe I can export to HTML for this rather than having to parse it all out myself custom like?\n\n\n\nThere are 2 routes I can take this from here for further development:\nCustom Markdown Processor Method\nOk, so I did the github thing, now I’d need to make a MARKDOWN PREPROCESSOR to generate the proper formatting for a Gist/HTML generation?\n\nCould I just do HTML generation and pop that on Vercel?\n\nHTML Generation Method\nI’ll try the html generation route and upload to Vercel.\nI might be able to make a script or some simple obsidian plugin that automagically uploads that info to Vercel post Parse!\nIf this works perfectly, it could be the easiest by far.\nElse I may have to do a combination of Markdown Processing and HTML generation before deploying with an intelligent router in NEXTjs?\nEither way, I’ll want to play around with the HTML Export Plugin!\n\nIn this case, I’d be exporting an entire vault?
