# Notes
Heading over into [[Heaven's Hospice]] to console [[Dur'zoga]] and [[Cello]]

### Semetra & Marinus
The person who possessed [[Semetra]] during our battle that resulted in Dur'zoga and Marinus dying changes with each Moon.
- Her people draw power from the moon.
- After migrating to Luyarnha, something changed in their power. It changed much like the phases of the moon.
	- Someone could always connect to the moon in a stronger way that they could, these people were referred to as [[Aspects]] of the moon?
	- 1 Confirmed Aspect of the moon has been... killed?

This time, it happened to be the 1st Vicor of the Radiant church: [[Vicor Priscilla]]
After the 33rd hunt, she went insane, was stabbed by a scourge beast, and presumed dead?
Marinus is an "Aspect"? Aspect of what? The void?

It appears that Semetra's people started dying off frequently following the 33rd hunt...
They were being drawn into their affiliation with the [[Eldritch Moon]]s...
The only reason she survived was due to being isolated, and drawn into the [[Jaeger Program]].

Semetra thinks the Radiant church holds more secrets about what happened during the 33rd moon.
Steinhardt, the 1st Jaeger also had something happen to him during the 33rd eldritch moon?!
- The last anyone had heard of him, he was headed into the Sewers of the Ruby district, to clear out the beasts there.

Marinus is hiding something about why he came to the city...
- For answers isn't good enough
- He's here looking for someone in particular...
	- Likely to solve the murder case he hinted towards in his intro
	- Nissahna Heelspark. The name of the person he's looking for.
People dissapearing after being accused of murder, and being loyal to the old ways of the world before 
Luminary scribes that tried to dig into the case seemingly got bumped off the case for looking into the case.
- Also following the case of someone named "Heelspark"
This Luminary scribe's name is [[Volker Daffrey]]

[[Paridous]] is the name of the jerk who didn't want to revive Marinus
### 
### What Waron should say to Cello/Dur'zoga
##### Waron would like to order:
The Smoking Gargoyle (8s)
Devils on Horse back  (6s)

Offer Dur'zoga a Pearly Gates' Sour (7s)

# Dinner
 Cello started seemingly unlocking some of her memory when coming into contact with [[Luna]].
 - Ballad of Moonlit princess runs through her in response to Luna's touch. (A piece by her mistress)

#### Cello opens up about her mistress's note
Cello's mistress told her to leave the city
Claims she deserves a better life outside.
Says the city is cursed.

Cello wants to investigate her Mistress's murder/attack
- Marinus appears to join in the conversation here

[Semetra] owes us one! We now have a favor from her, no questions asked!
- She offered to Dur'zoga, to be clear.

#### Cello's Rune box with arcane scribing
- It's written in Gothic Arcane
	- Not the normal Draconic
	- A spell was emblazoned into the box: An arcane lock with a *heavy* enchantment/transmutation modification
		- If someone had KNOCK they could open it!
- Minerva's closest association with someone who would be capable of doing something like this:
	- [[Michelangelo]] Holy shit.
	- [[Carmella]]. Someone she knew, but Cello didn't really know?
	- [[The Ivory Strings]] Rival Musician. Only real competitor with their family.
		- Father: Ferric
		- Mother Delanie
		- Older brother Parahorn
		- Younger Brother Layalin
		- Their music was *allegedly* magical in nature

Oh shit, we need to prep for the upcoming Eldritch moon!

#### Bad Bitches With Mean Stitches
- Shop for armor/clothing. Jaegers get their fits here!
- I asked where I could get some more durable duds

Waron is consoled at the Paladins of the Eldritch hunt by the shop keep on the rough day he's had. Surprisingly Waron opens up about feeling like a failure after the day/nights proceedings. Having felt like he let down his party members, failing to finish off the Dullahan, going down to a mere two opponents and having party members die as a result.
- Alluding to himself not being as durable suddenly as a reference to the fact that he had 4 max hp reduced due to the house of blood syringe bit, which did in fact matter in that combat.

A recruit, human man in low 20s
- Respects Waron.
- One of those I saved during the last Eldritch Moon.
- Duncan! His name is Duncan! He's now an Initiate in the Hunt!
	- I swear to God if Hunter kills this man just to fuck with Waron I will throw hands

Cello & Waron failed their flashback Dice rolls (2 and 3 respectively)
Marinus's Flashback
Dur'zoga Flashback 
She flashes back to her childhood, hands small, her father a huge imposing figure.
He was letting her play with a prized Emerald of their family, alluded to have somehow played a role in Dur'zoga being conceived?
Her father being an Orc, and her mother being a human.
Mother scolding her for nearly swallowing this precious Emerald.

The area she grew up around: Rover District
- mostly half orcs & humans
- A tiefling or two

The emerald is reveled as being a part of her mother's necklace, matching her mothers eyes, and Dur'zoga skin. Likely the equivalent of a wedding ring

### Verena and Cello
Verena asks Cello a few questions about the box, having not seen it before at the pub
She nat 20s, and identifies the unique spell locking the box.
- There's a contingency spell placed on it? (Contingency being the spell name)
	- Requires something specific to happen for the box to open
		- Maybe it requires a specific song to be played to open?
		- The inscription reads: "To my princess in the moonlight, finish what I could not."
			- Alludes to a song? Verse? Vengeance?

Cello plays the song "The moonlight princess" to the box, rolls a 22.
- Fucking NAILS it.
- NoOnesThereToAupplause.jpeg
- Box does not open
