# [Master's Name] Manor murder mystery.
Cello's home

Met Jaeger Moralis at Cello’s house?

- He’s a baldie!
    

Something seems to be very wrong.

  

Cello’s Master is renowned as a famous story teller!

- Plays? Playwrights?
    

Are they thinking she committed suicide?

There's a critic of her latest performance?

- Did she seem down?
    

She didn’t make the performance?

  

She’s in some sort of Coma?

Maybe a Dulahan took her soul?

- Her eyes were closed, so her head is still there, so maybe not…?
    



Upon witnessing the state of her Mistress, Cello gains some Madness (Scourge automaton)
- Beast inside has been released!
- Hands are claws now (1 d6 slashing per claw, can attack twice)
- Advantage on dex saves!  

Would Waron notice the change in her hands? Or even worse, what it means?
- Waron’s somewhat familiar with Madness & the scourge  

Fungus spilling out of her master’s head? 

- This sounds awful

Some kind of poison?

No, it WAS the scourge! She was infected with it…

- It weakened her immune system? Beastial instinct took over?
- She was POISON’d on the night of the hunt with some poison that infected her with the scourge
- We found traces of her blood from about 3 nights prior that had traces of scourge already...


#### What we know:
Happened on the night of the Hunt.
She woke up on a train, Waron would be able to key in more info!
- Would Waron be listening in?

## Note in the fireplace

“I’ve finally managed to find someone perfect for me. Just the piece I needed to center me in my life again. They claimed they didn’t need a name, but just calling them something based on a number seems odd. I’ll make it a play on her serial number for short. I hope she likes it. Ever since–”

Can Waron pick up a scent on the note? [I rolled a nat 20 lmao]
- Marbled stone and lilac
- Follow it to a leather bound diary!
    
“To my princess in the moonlight, finish what I could not”
- Note by a locked box Cello found in her Mistress’s bedroom

Coughing in her Mistress’s room, smashed mirror, etc? 
- Bloodied handkerchief?

Cello’s Mistress’s body still seems to be alive?!
- Is she being taken over by Scourge Fungus?!
- Unconscious but her body yet breaths

They’re saying she needs to be “purged” due to the scourge infection.
- Waron should be able to go about investigating this without risk, since he’s already infected.
