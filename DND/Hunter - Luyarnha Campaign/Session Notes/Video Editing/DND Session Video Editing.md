# The General template to get my audio to match up with my current hardware setup:

## Hardware list
> [!error] TODO
> Set this up based on the object template system I want to add!
> So for future audio setups, I know to tweak/use a different config!

## Audio
In Fair light Audio, Click on Dynamics, enable it, and set the Threshold to -22db and range to 18.

I wonder if there is a good way to do "Templates" in Davinci resolve, so I can smack in a video, and have it get a set of features applied to it, for consistent audio etc.
- If not, I could always do something like this via python scripts!
### Fairlight Audio presets?
This seems like the way to go!
