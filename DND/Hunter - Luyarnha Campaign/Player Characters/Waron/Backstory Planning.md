## What God is Waron sworn to?
- A God of fear or something chaotic would be awesome, rather than the light
- I need to talk with Hunter about this at some point

# Which Pack Leader do I want to work under?
I have the option to study under any of them, given my impressive feats on the battle field during the entrance into Luyarnha.

I wanted to ask Hunter some questions about each Pack Leader, to see which would be a good fit for Waron.
- I need a list of Names for this! (I think I asked Hunter for this a while ago)

Gameplay wise, I think it would make sense for Waron to go under someone who's under [[Thokk]] (Pack Lord) as a member of the defense core.
- There are 3 Pack Leaders per Pack Lord.

#### How I'd like to RP my choice of Pack Leader to follow
I'd like to flavor my decision as a result of feeling less durable lately.
I've been going down when I shouldn't be, as though I've gotten weaker since...
- The blood letting. (I want that HP back damn it!)
- I can also use this as a good opportunity to get some better armor (plate!)
	- This would normally cost around 1,500gp...
	- Maybe I could barter that scroll of daylight or some other items for it?
## Pack Leaders
### Lieutenant [[Faeleth]]
The spear specialist of the group
- I'd be working w/ door man if I joined this group!
- I also did her a solid during the last eldritch moon, so I'm in their good graces
### [[Vresh]]
Slow moving offense specialist.
- Think siege warfare.


# Next session discussion with the Vicor:
### About Cello's Mistress
Is there really nothing that can be done? I, of anyone, know what the scourge is like. Though can they truly not be saved?
- I think I can tie this moment into Waron's reveal? Or maybe that would be better saved for later...


> [!error]  #### Waron WRATHFUL BREAK
> I want Waron to have a WRATHFUL BREAK at some point (as a part of his character)
> - Probably after drinking the blood vial

### Potential Quips

- I’M GOING TO TEAR OFF YOUR LIMBS AND CHOKE YOU TO DEATH WITH YOUR OWN HANDS!
- “[Deity Name Here]’s TAINT! What is that SMELL?!”
- “The only good beast is a dead beast. Now Let’s make these beasts good”
- “BY RADIANCE, BE BLIND!!”
### Unrelated quips:
- “Are you afraid of [insert monster name here]? That’s something someone with a fear of [insert monster name here] would say."
- “I helped you once, when you really needed it, but you’re not helpless. What would make you say something like that?”
- Dear Lord of light, I hath seen thy face, and that thou art weeping
	- "Does cross symbol with hand over body"
