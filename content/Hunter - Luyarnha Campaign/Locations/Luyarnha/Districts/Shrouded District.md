One of the main areas in the [[Luyarnha]].

# Description

Forever cloaked in darkness by the massive cathedral stretching across the waters and the suffocating smog from nearby mine workings, the Shrouded District is home to many a soul. 

The gloom grants refuge to those who oppose the power of the Silverblood royalty, it provides alternatives to those seeking spirituality away from the light, and finally, it gives way to establishments of debauchery and carnal desires, such as brothels and narcotic dens, where the city's laborers seek solace and escape from their harsh realities in hedonistic pursuits. 

However, this hidden haven is not without its dangers, as man-made monsters and virulent diseases lurk unseen in the shadows.
