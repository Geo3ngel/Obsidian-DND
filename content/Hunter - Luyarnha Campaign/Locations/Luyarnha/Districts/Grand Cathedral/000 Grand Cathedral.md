One of the main areas in the [[Luyarnha]].

# Description

The colossal cathedral, standing sentinel at Luyarnha's heart, accommodates citizens, commerce, and sacred shrines, rendering it an crucial piece of infrastructure within the city-state. 

From its outer walls the building covers around 5 square kilometers (2 square miles), with the highest spire standing at 900 meters tall (3000 feet tall) making it as much an edifice as its own town. 

Built on multiple floors—as above, so below—the Cathedral is said to be able to house the entirety of Luyarnha's population in times of crisis, though access to it is not so easily granted. Consequently, the structure metamorphosed into the intended sacred cathedral, though now its halls echo with worship solely of the Radiant One.
