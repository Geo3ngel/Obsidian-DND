One of the main areas in the [[Luyarnha]].

# Description

Towering above the Sanctified District lays the dominating silhouette of the Silverblood Castle—a physical manifestation of the insurmountable divide between the privileged few and the wretched multitude. 

Built alongside the walls of the city after the establishment of a sovereign Luyarnha, when half-elves first rose to prominence, it is bridged to the city by an intimidating stone staircase. 

Located upon the higher grounds of the city, the castle’s gothic spires and turrets scrape the star-ridden skies, declaring a challenge to both the heavens the nobility so desperately wish to conquer, and the spreading Scourge that ceaselessly gnaws at the city's foundations. 

Shrouded behind the austere stone walls and brooding parapets, the Silverblood lineage continues to cling to Luyarnha’s power. Through a tenuous combination of wealth, ancestral magic, and political power, they manipulate the city's social fabric—particularly amongst nobles—enforcing a fragile, fear-ridden order in their quest for survival beneath the thumb of the Radiant Church.
