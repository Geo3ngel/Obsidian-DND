# Appearance [Armor ON]
Waron sports a full body set of armor. Covering every spec of *"flesh"* save for his eyes glowing through the slits in his helm.
# Appearance under the armor [Armor OFF]
I want Waron to look as though he's been mauled by *something* to a viscous degree. As though he clearly ought naught have survived.

This twisted flesh intermingled with grafted wolf esc features, poorly showing through in various areas. 
- Nose bridged into the shape of a wolves, but still human flesh
- Fleshy ears, half way between human and wolf like. Fur/hair growing on the back
- Hair color made into a combination of dark and light silver, seeming to grow farther along patches of his face than it should, twisting with warped skin here and there
	- Long, Light Silvery Eyelashes
- Scathing Red Crimson eyes with pitch black Sclera, and blotchy black Pupils (Not quite round)
- Hands with pads on grotesquely elongated human hands, with claws seemingly ripping out where the tips of his fingers should be.
- Knees and ankles have been twisted/extended to that of a more lycanthropic figure, with matted fur covering *everything* from the waist down.
- Very hairy elbows
- Eyebrows that look about read to become a crysalis
- Mouth full of jagged, vicious teeth

**Almost werewolf-like, but as though they were caught halfway in a transformation. Some parts stuck man, others wolfen/beastly in a grotesque manner.**
## Physical Description

Disfigured face, wears a helmet and armor to hide the deformations caused by grafting prey into their own flesh to strengthen themselves.

Note that scourgeborne Belua have bright crimson red eyes, as such the helmet could be justified to hide the character’s eyes.

#### Disfigurements
Need to figure out what kind of disfigurements I’m going to do? (Will depend on race)
	Deep/Dark Grey wolfen features, with a mouth full of jagged, vicious teeth.
	Human skin with patches of wolf like fur
	Grotesque Clawed hands hidden by Gauntlets. (Think claws growing out of normal human fingers)
    Almost werewolf-like, but as though they were caught halfway in a transformation. Some parts stuck man, others wolfen/beastly in a grotesque manner.

Riddled with scars, one particularly nasty having torn across half his face, disfiguring it even further than the half-wolfen features. 
	- I need a better description for his scars
	- Should I make his face incredibly worn, in addition to a few scars?
		- One notably cutting across from around his head over his ear, wrapping around just under his right eyelid
		- Another appears starting from his upper lip, across his lower, and down across the left side of his chin. Notably appears rather deep cut, and further exposes his gnarled teeth.
**Inspiration**: This but mixed with the werewolf from Harry Potter (Ugly as hell)

The idea is to make him so ugly, people would attack him thinking he's a monster on sight.
- Even those who know him well.
