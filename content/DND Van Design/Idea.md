The concept is a mobile van/bus/home, retro fitted with custom built out kit to plan and play DND on the road!

---
Become a traveling DM!
- Could build a website for this too!
- Discord Members/patron for Gas money?

Meet up with groups at locations all across the US to play one shots!
- Perfect setting for Battle of the bards?

Complete with LED lighting, sound system, pop up Table
Dice rollers, dice dispensers

DND on the road!

Stream/record each session!

This would be awesome to do with Hunter at some point!

My co-worker Nick plays over watch w/ the puzzle box YT channel guy
might make an interesting connection for designs?

Could do upgrade/matinence sessions across the country on the Van!

Could look into DM travel setups

Possibly even consider buying cheap plots of land in states I like, so I can legally stay in state parks and the like?

# Custom Guts
Control computer
Stream/Recording Computer
> [!note] Probably more practical to have 1 pc doing it all for starters...

See if I can hook up cooling for PCs and such to the radiator/VAN cooling system, rather than having fans pushing hot air into the setup?
- Also target a low Decibel count.
Surround sound speaker setup
Custom LED lighting
Optional Fog machine
- Not sure how safe this would be for a VAN.
- Also have a fan to blow the fog out maybe?
Solar panels on the roof for remote powering?
- potentially have retractile covers to protect them during travel/storms?

I should start either designing, or specing out what I'd need, costs, etc.

For example, how much wattage would I need to power everything?
What size battery should I get to provide what I'd need for say a full DND stream? (In watt hours I think?)
- Do I need to support 240v car battery chargers?

Maybe projectors, or use that conductive paint for displaying environment stuff on the walls/ceilings?
- This one might need the most experimentation if I wanted to mess with it.
# The table
I'd like something sturdy, and cleverly built.
Ideally, it'd pop up out of the floor, ready to go!

## Pieces
For physical DND, it's always nice to have figurines, terrain, etc.
However, I'd likely be very limited in what I could fit in the VAN...
Maybe keep it all digital on a screen based table?
Or have custom shelving/storage in the floors for different figurine types?

The ideal would be holograms, but I don't think that's practical lol.
- maybe if we have VR headsets for the players, and QR codes/markers for the models to map onto?
	- That'd be a lot of dev effort!
	- But the storage could be super compact...
- Or we could just do peppers ghost type stuff?
Dice dispensers?
- not necessary at all, but could be a fun one to play around with.
- Could even do something fancy, like have a fish tank or something with dice that get flung up, and land slowing/dramatically in the water to roll.
	- How would I get them out properly though? Fish net?
	- Or roll via shaking?
	- Would be sick af for underwater scenes to roll dice underwater physically
- I could also store them in tubes with a stopper?
- Or in some little pneumatic chamber, so they shoot out?
## Potential gotchas
**Vibration resistance**:
Everything, including all table mechanisms would need to be super vibration resistant.

# Minimalist DM Kit ideas

It would be good to have some of these on hand, or take some of the concepts for DMing these games in a compact space!
# Other kit ideas
DM Screen with a built in display:

- could also use an ipad or tablet or something on the inside? idk.
# Extensions of this idea
[[DND Plane]]
Like the DND Van/bus idea I'm currently putting together, but for flying!
- Could be applicable to Blaine for a custom plane build!
