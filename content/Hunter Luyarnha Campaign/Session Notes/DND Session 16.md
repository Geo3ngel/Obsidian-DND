# Session Prep
---
## Shopping
I need to try and get that HP back from the shop keep at the [[Sanctified Sinner]]

Looking to acquire armor from [[Bad Bitches With Mean Stitches]]

## Things to address this Session
Waron pick a [[Pack Leader]]?
- One of those under [[Thokk Bloodbather]]
- I was "sleeping on it"
- I think I'll go for [[Geiger]]

Cello's Rune box?
- Only Verena knows about this aside from Cello currently.

Pry the Vicor for information w/ Marinus & Semetra?

Waron wants to ask Narissa about the house of blood, in relation to the blood they drew from him.
- He's feeling off/weakened

---
# Notes
---
## Narissa at the Luminary Scribes
[[Narissa]] is slandered by the Luminary Scribes upon trying to Karen her way to compensation for their prior aggression.

Sanctified Sinner's Owner is [[Nezmus]], the white skinned tiefling.
> [!error] Create character sheet.

### [[Nezmus]]
A Jaeger? (Meister?)
Seems to allude to having fought and lost a lot of men recently, not from the eldritch moon.

Narissa seems to get along with them, as they reciprocate the apparent discrimination against tieflings in [[Luyarnha]].

According to him, everything Arcane is vulnerable to eldritch corruption within the city.
And tieflings, being a demon race, have the arcane in their blood.

Informs Narissa that all water has been blocked off via the water works for Paterna Iter...
They're trying to starve out the city, and avoid Jaeger...

### Narissa attempts to debate her way out of the "Stain" on her record from the Luminary Scribes
The Psions are given privy to experimentation for things that would otherwise be considered "Heresy?"
### Outside the Luminary scribes
[[Da'ul]] was waiting outside, eaves dropping on the conversation.

# In Session now
Waron notices the bell tolling, which indicates a Eldritch Moon is going to occur that night.

> [!error] Add Character name & page!

The dude [[]] who resurrected Marinus shows up at the door of the house most of the party is staying at.
Informs the party the Vicor wishes to receive his report.

## Jaeger Meister Paratus?!
Giving out small blessings to the people to protect them during the eldritch moon.

From the top of the grand Cathedral the night we entered the city.
## Meeting with the Vicor
> [!error] More notes to be added to this section!

Vicor Abraham's chambers are inside the [[Luminary Repository]] in the grand cathedral
### Debriefing the Vicor
Quilandros Family targeted, Head of the house was killed

The Ruby district seems to be the source..
- it's cordoned off
- Scourge folk are sent there if not killed on the spot

Asking for Mercy for Cello's Mistress.

Scourge "Cure" supposedly comes from a scourge mushroom, stemming from the sewer...
- banned information, void within the luminary repository.
	- blocked from public access
	- Research "Carmella"

Carmella's name was mentioned by Cello!
- The guest her mistress met with the night before Cello head outside of the city!
- HIGHLY suspect!

Jaeger Moralis is in charge now of keeping Cello's Mistress safe and quarantined.
He agreed to prevent her from being "disposed of", as a scourge born.

### Howling moon tonight!
Banned information is regulated by[[ Obulis Scholare]]
- How tf is this shit spelled
- Controller by [[Michelangelo]]

Marinus searches the Luminary Scribes ledgers for Ms. [[Heel spark]]
- Finds nothing despite rolling well
- Finds mention of her under immigration records, in association with a group known as [[The Fire Keepers]]
	- Marinus found a list of the members names, though one appears to be blacked out.

Waron asks Narissa/Verena about him accidentally signing a blood pact with the house of blood/giving them his blood being a bad thing or not.
- He's essentially sold his soul for 200g

## Monster in the Water Works
Mutated Lykan of some sort from the water works
- Some form of Werewolf
Slayed a Jaeger!
- Lone Jaeger though. Still, a big blow to the church...
Uses Ambush tactics!

Has a slight regenerative ability
Mannerisms are that of a scourge beast
- heightened smelling/hearing
Otherworldly mobility

Called a The [[cleric beast]] by our order.
Took two Lutenients to kill it!

Will be powered up by the Howling moon!
- Gain a natural proclivity to howl for power

---

Currently the Jaeger [[Karliel the White]] was sent out to search for it, but hasn't been able to find anything.
- Maybe we can mask his scent? Or get his assistance on the night of the hunt, seeing as it likely will be out in the open?

[[Abyssal Keep]]?
- Apparently broken up into 3 levels.
- Refer back to video to find what these are called, and notate in the relevant Location page.
## TODO: 
I need to head to the shop of blood, though I'd like to go by the [[Bad Bitches With Mean Stitches]] shop first?
Then the house of blood, ideally with a plan/crew to back him?
- Should he go there first?! Or Get new threads to start?
# Lore of Luyarnha before the War
Look back in the video to annotate this!
- [[Dur'zoga]] reading
# Shopping
## Hugo's Shop
Narissa & Marinus visit Hugo down in [[Paterna Iter]]

Our party purchases the right to travel to and from Paterna Iter permanently for 1000g.
- [[Da'ul]] contributes 750g, and the rest of us 50g each to be able to afford it.
	- We didn't all pay 50, right? Only 5 of us would need to.
> [!error] TODO: 
> Note hugo's shop mods and goods listed by hunter at the end of Narissa's questioning!
> I also should add the mods Marinus & Narissa applied to their weapons.

## The Silver Wolf
Waron, Cello, and Dur'zoga head over to [[The Silver Wolf]] to coat a bunch of Dur'zoga's weapons in silver.
Waron pretends the weapons are his, putting his hands behind his back to receive them from Dur'zoga to give to [[]].

Dur'zoga hands him the busted silver axe to melt down for the silver component, and the following weapons to coat, costing 43g total. (cost lowered due to providing the silver)
- Meat hooks
- 5 javelins
- Hand Axe/Hatchet? **(Needs video review)**
## Bad Bitches with Mean Stitches
Waron asks other party members if they have any plans, or if they want to come with him to [[Bad Bitches With Mean Stitches]] for some armor/cloth shopping
- Sponsored by the Jaeger administration
- Long white haired human woman

### Purchases made
- Cello purchased a [[Hat trick]].
- Marinus purchased a set of [[Silken socks of slickening]]
- Waron purchased an armor modification job, to add the benefits of a hunters coat to his chain armor

### Verena also gave Waron an amulet!
- He needs to attune for this!
- Helps ward off blood magic, to help with his fuck up of selling his blood for cheap!

# Campaign Spelling Bee Event!
Date and time TBD!
