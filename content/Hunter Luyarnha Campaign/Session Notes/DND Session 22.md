# Session Intro

We start off in Hugo's shop, [[The powdered Emporium]] at the end of the moon.

Maybe we should seek out that hunter we rescued?
- The wounded hunter, named [[Borast]] under [[Greisha Bearknuckle]]'s command

# Session Notes
---
The wendigo that Narissa's been seeing in visions is some kind of urban legend of the city...
Known to have some sort of connection to people within the city?
Reports sited all across?
Known as [[The veiled Hunter]]
- Sighted since the first war.
- Highly classified
Jaeger Meisters turn down the investigations into this creature.
- The church not wanting to investigate it?
No one's ever seen it kill anyone... just watching. Examining. 
- Is it some kind of warning/omen?

Spiritual beings tend to have some form of innate hostility (gheists etc) no real thoughtfulness to them...
The veiled hunter seems to be different.
One thing of note that every knight of the eldritch hunt knew:
- Should you ever encounter this being, you avoid it. You don't mess with it.
- Seems to be some kind of bad omen.

We promised Hugo some wine/drinks the next time we're by.

### Commissions from Hugo!

	- Will take 2 days!

	- Shoots out of it's mouth

When we arrived at the cathedral...
[[La-donna]], the desk receptionist, informs us the Vicor is meeting with the assistant to Vicor Abraham...

## We received: 
$7k gold
Militiaman tokens!
- we can now get into the cathedral from any other district.
### [[The veiled Hunter]] 
It's the apex predator of the city.
It's patient.
It waits for the right moment...
This beast is probably some form of BBEG...
It has some kind of vengence... 
- targets people with connection to the grand Cathedral.
Per High apostle Lugarious's demands, it's info was banned.

A single squad survived this beast's madness...
- with a single survivor
- Jaeger Meister Calvin. He's not mad, he's not sane... just, different.
	- He managed to avoid whatever that creature did to him by removing his own eyes.
	- He's the assistant to [[Greisha Bearknuckle]]

[[Vicor Rhanya]] was one of the best luminary scribes...

An association getting rambunctious with the Civilians

- Militiamen getting into fights with this small gang?

Shrouded district...
Some beast lurking in the shadows...
leaving behind bodies torn to shreds.
No blood, completely siphoned... torn out?

- Pyramid head?
- High apostle Lugarious

# Waron bits
---

Waron needs to have a chat w/ Verena about what they saw in his vision
- Laiya Waron's (Lover? Wife?)
- To Waron, it felt like a Nostalgic dream...
	- There's the presence of something that brought be away from the rage that was consuming Waron.
Marinus was pretty badass during that last combat, need to give him props for the timing on that gravity spell!

Potential Quote to use for next Session:
"Huff, Huff... Ha-ha... guess I'm a bit, WARON out right now.. huff.. hehe-he..."

Narissa is kind of a hoarder for scrap bits, good to know!
