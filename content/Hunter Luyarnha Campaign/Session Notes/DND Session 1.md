# Location: [[The Iron Smoker]]
---
Because we didn’t know last time, the train is called the “The Iron Smoker”. Gray noticed that there are eyes looming in the darkness along with something flying across the sky seemingly carrying something. Gray attempts to intimidate Da’ul with a spear, telling him that if he listens to him “everything will be fine” who asks him if he’s running. Dur’zoga overhears and intimidates Gray, who turns away. As Waron patrols the car he watches the tension in Gray and the hostility in the are and passes by Cell, who is fraught with anxiety. Waron realizes that Cello is a somehow physically emotized mannequin from Luyarnha.

“Don’t worry now Ms. ceramic, I’d say the trip is about half way over now.” he reassures her as he moves on . He comes across Marinus held up in the end of the bar cart. “Oh wow, it’s been quite a while since I’ve seen anyone take up at the bar. How is it?” he asks, nodding to the whiskey. “Well if anything it’s a well stocked bar.” Marinus replies as Waron moves to stand guard in the corner. Narissa and Waron note a corner with a scratched and marked map of Luyarnha, witch Narissa casually picks up and stuffs in her jacket. Some notice that the train is vibrating with a thumping out the outside. Waron in conversation tells Marinus that the train doesn’t normally do this. Cello feels that something about this train is off, that something had changed in the train. They try to think about this but are met by a migraine once again. Marinus inquires about her, noticing her expression of pain. “Have you tried turning yourself off and back on again?” he asks. “I don’t think I work that way.” Cello responds before Marinus proceeds to drink more and turn his attention out the window.
    
Gray notices the train speeding up before Gray looks at Dur’zoga and points at the window, Dur’zoga looks out the window and sees a shadow closing towards the train. She calls over Waron “Do you see this shit? There’s something outside!” Waron looks outside seeing a shadow noting that the candle has burned lower than they should’ve. He tells Durzoga “Something ain’t right.” Durzoga says “Things just ain’t right out there.” There’s a large bang and something hits the top of the train and the train lurches. Durzoga to Gray and get up in his face asking “What else have you seen.”.“You’re not gonna like this “ Gray says and take a sip from his flask before Durzoga swipes his flask. “You’re gonna have to learn to fly.” - Gray Narissa hears claws and a thump on the ceiling and readies her guns grinning in a nonchalant way. Gray screams”Everyone grab your weapons.” Cello faintly recognizes something familiar about the creature. Marinus pulls out his light crossbow setting it on the table before him before taking another drink. Durzoga readies her battle ax and recalls that Luyarnha. has been quarantined due to a Scurge. Waron “Now what exactly did you see out there.” Cello “I think it's a beast or bird of some kind.” And she sees a large eye of a large looking crow. Warren recognizes it as a Corvian Dwellers - Paterna Iter he would know that the corvid dwellers attack tha agriculture of the western district “Better not be one of those damn Scurge birds.” Waron says. The train suddenly lurches as something shatters through the glass a human like crow enters, shrouded in dark cloth Narissa shoots it, prepared for it. Grey undergoes MADNESS - Scream - 1d12 thunder damage Feels the need to scream
    
Durzoga sees the creature and is Fraught with terror, suddenly seeing her hands as if they were caked in blood. She drops her hand ax in fear. Gray attacks the birdman with his spear. Gray tries to scream at the door to open it but fails. He yells out :“Stay away from the window.” The Corvid tries to lurch away from the spear and looks at Gray, pissed. He claws Durzhiga and bites; Narissa fires off another two shots coursing the cave of the skull to fall off. Cello heals Gray and begs marinus “kill it, kill it please.” Dur’zoga looks at her hands, screaming and slams her fists into the exposed part of the birdman’s skull before stumbling backwards. As she backs away the birdman attacks her with its talons, heavily damaging her. Marinus shoots the birdman with his crossbow. Waron skewers the birdman to the chair by it, killing it. “Non combatants get down and cover your ears!” As he stabs it through its eye hole. Narissa prods the birdman making sure it’s dead. Cello helps Durzoga up from the floor “Can I heal you?” They ask and they help Durzoga up. Marinus examines the bird man with his knife. The wings seem broken as if they were designed for soaring and sees that the anatomy had six different vocal cords. “Is this one of those Skurge birds?’ Marinus asks. “Farmers normally have troubles with them. Something is missing.” Waron replies.
    
The train is still speeding ahead. Waron says “oh fuck.” When asked about what he saw, Da’ul says “They’re might be some unexpected guests in the next car.” “How many do you reckon you hear? I can’t imagine they’re friendly.” Waron kicks in the door, seeing four figures the car ahead with wooden barrels. “Skurge-born” Waron says as he sees them. Cello hunkers down “Is there anything I should do?”. “I owe you one, I will do whatever it is I can do to get you off of this train.” Grey says tp Cello. Waron shouts “we’ve got looters over here.” he says before getting pinned by one of the individuals. Waron hits him with his shield before unhinging, Warn, unseen by anyone else lowers the bottom of his helmet and tries to bite the man but it is prevented as the man ducks behind some wood.
    
Marinus grabs his note book but his jacket opens along with his ribcage as dark viscera filled with rage attacks one of the men. Marinus seems to barely pull the entity back inside of him. “Away foul beast, away!” One with a torch yells attacking Marinus. At the behest of Gray, Cello and Durzoga move up to the car. Waron removes the latch of his helmet and tears apart one of the looter’s faces. “Hope that wasn’t your first kiss,” Waron says to Marinus as he kills one the assailants near Marinus. Warinus tries to clean off some of the ‘lipstick’ blood like marks on Waron’s helmet. Grey spears another one of the assailants through the chest with his spear. As he goes up to help Waron he removes his cloak to reveal a uniform similar to the guards at the station. He screams at the enemy somehow causing some sort of damage to it before killing it with a strike of his spear. Waron once again unleashes his bite onto the remaining assailant, rippings its throat out and swallowing it, which Marinus sees. “Don’t give in to those emotions. People tend to lose themselves to their emotions in fights around here.” Waron says Marinus opens the door to the train as Waron swears again that they are still moving. The party moves to the next car.
