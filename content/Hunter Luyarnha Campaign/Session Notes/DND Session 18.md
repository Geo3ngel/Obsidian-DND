# Session Intro
---
We're still in combat, surrounded and kind of *fuckedâ„¢*.

Midst of an eldritch moon, Many of us under the negative effects of the beastial moon due to failing our wisdom saving throws.

A thunderous howl echo's in the distance...
- The [[Cleric Beast]] is coming, we don't know how long we have...
---
# Combat
### Narissa
We start off with Narissa firing off at a bunch of the doggos and the like.
She repositions and takes an attack from the green larger wolf, but retaliates with hellish rebuke (double check this is what it's called) as her reaction to it's reaction!
Then uses an AOE attack against the others Grey and I are holding off!
- They all fail their saves and take additional fire damage!

### Verena
Casts burning hands on the green wolf that had just reacted to Narissa.

Waron keeps shit missing sadly.

Dur'zoga expertly pins the red Corvian dweller, effectively grappling him with her bale hooks

Cello gets Grey back up w/ 8hp.
- The ribcage bones are still up though?
- How does this work? Can he exit easily if he so desires?

Waron finally hits and smites the red doggo to murk him.
- I really shouldn't have smite'd him, though it makes sense as Waron being frustrated since he's in a rage right now.
- 
Waron catches the scent of the [[Cleric Beast]], it's growing closer...
Waron's starting to feel a... *thirst* of sort.
- That vial of reborn blood might just come into play sooner or later!

Marinus spots the [[cleric beast]], it looks to be a few hundred feet North West currently.
- Waron doesn't hear his notifying of the group though!

# Boss Prep
---
The crew is given 2 minutes to prep their strategy and setup for the upcoming boss fight.

We come up with a questionable ambush strategy, with everyone spread out and hidden, planning to blast this MOFO from range, with Waron and Cello in the center of the Arena to Tank DPS.
