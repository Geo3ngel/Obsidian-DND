# Notes
We start the session in the clearing of the forest within the Tree from the Garden.
- Walked through via tree strider
- [[Semetra]] is with us.

**[[Waron]]** tries to sniff out the people in the clearing
The "essence" of these beings is similar to that of the [[Paladins of the Eldritch Hunt]].
> [!info] Does this imply they are scourge borne?
According to [[Narissa]]'s perception, they appear to be some kind of Lichen? Or Subspecies category of wendigo?!

Lichen are like nature spirit golems? Creature of the woods of sorts.

[[Ormiir]] summoned the **Dullahans** that murdered Phillip (and tried to send the )
- What are there intentions?
- Known as the summoner of **Dullahans**? 
	- TO JOIN THEM FOR SYMBIOSIS
He has superiors?
[[The Circle of Symbiosis]]
- The circle of Symbiosis?!
There is a VERY high likely hood that Cello's  master was attacked/poisoned by this cult!


# Battle
I need to Hungry jaws to get some HP back!
Range weapons are idea here, so Try using my scythe!

On my next turn, I'd like to Hungry Jaws & Attack with my scythe!

Spectral slash to get to the other side of greenie, with divine smite!
- Then bite for more HP! (Maybe do this in the reverse order just in case!)

Oh! I can push the orange one into the void with my weapon if I transform it back!

> [!error] Sumetra seems to have been possesses by some divine being!
>**"Providence of the light has blessed us this battle! We cannot lose!"**

Ormiir seems to be doing his own equivalent of Channel divinity!?
- The voice that we've been hearing in our minds is coming from this being?!
- It beaconed Ormiir to return!

[[Waron]] was down when Marinus was confronted about being a shard of the void, potentially being able to destroy the world?!
- Chance to "Become a great one?"
- SPAWN OF THE BLACK GOAT?! (referred to by the god like figure that possessed Semetra?!)

>[!help] Oh, can Waron actually have a different being he's faithful to? 
>He pretends/acts as though it's the light?
>Perhaps it's actually something else, but he doesn't recall due to his memory being wiped?

Fuck, I should have tried hungry jaws to bite to heal, then Spectral slash 10 feet away from the mob, applied smite!

[[Marinus]] and [[Dur'zoga]] both died to the God like figure that possessed Semetra?!

### When I'm brought back up:
"Urgh, what'd I miss? Ah, ugh, Marinus, you got any more of that- ...Marinus..? Where..."
What... what happened?
- ...I see. (Waron's seen a lot of death as a paladin of the eldritch hunt)
	- He would slump. (Not angry here, but depressed...)
**Waron wouldn't blame Semetra, if anything would want to alleviate her guilt**
- sympathy based on the paladin's of the eldritch hunt tending towards a similar nature
	- Losing themselves to the scourge blood and the like.
	- This might be the moment for Waron to finally show his face...
		- Or at Marinus & Dur'zoga's funeral rite
	- "*Hey. That wasn't you. You didn't do that. So don't blame yourself.*"

Spectral slash for additional movement to carry Marinus to the cathedral ASAP!
- Within 24 hours!

After the failures in this last battle, Waron would think he needs more practice with the scythe, and go to train in solitude as his means of morning. So as to not let himself fail others in battle again.

Sumetra uses a diamond to revive Dur'zoga
We rush to the savior's Servant to try and revive Marinus!

The cosmic skinned fellow in the church is in the middle a ritual that we interrupt, to demand he revive Marinus.
- They refuse to revive Marinus initially, despite
Narissa & I plead/threaten for this sake. For him to be brought back.
- Waron noting how he died protecting the people of Luyarnha. Insinuates the church man is a coward who cares not for the people
Marinus is it's "Aspect?"
- The black goat's aspect of the void perhaps?
Marinus is told who he must become...
- The rest of us do not know this information.
- He is then brought back to life!

Waron would be a bit concerned that he died to.
- He'd thank Cello, and ask her if he died too?
Sumetra's experiencing some form of PTSD?!

### [[Verena]] is apart of some kind of Prophesy within [[The Circle of Symbiosis]] ?!
