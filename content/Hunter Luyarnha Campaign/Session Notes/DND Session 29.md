# Session Notes

## Marius's dream
He's in the middle of some sort of territorial dispute between massive moon scale entities.
Some large eye like creature appears first, searching for him throughout the city... When it spots him, and begins to draw him in, another being appears to pull him through his void, in the opposite direction. The other being begins to flee in it's presence.

The void like moon being instructs him to "Prevent emptiness".
> [!question] Is the eye like being from the silver tonic, in association with the church?
> It appears to be inferior to whatever void like being backs Marinus.

## Waron dreams of [[The founding of the Paladins of the Eldritch Hunt]]
Waron awakens to anxiety, next to a young Ludwig in a wear house by a bleeding werewolf 
**Date**: 2nd of Altruac 1011 A.E. 

He was pinned down a bit, and Waron got the killing blow
- it didn't die until we used the church's holy water, despite stabbing it in the heart, cutting it's intestines, etc...
The church wanted to ensure some form of loyalty...
- So they had us swear an oath to the church and people of Luyarnha.
Ludwig told them we drink the blood of our enemies as a ritual of sorts...
- This is totally how the paladins of the eldritch hunt contracted the scourge, isn't it? As part of their initiation ritual, they're made to drink blood due to Ludwig's edginess.

## Grey's Dream
Grey dreams of his survival with the Princess in the wilderness.

Things are starting to get rather dire, as they're on their last set of rations, and Grey has been giving more to the princess, starting to feel his hunger.

They playfully assert new nicknames for one another, as Queen Ruby of the rags, and Captain Grey. Grey being named after the color of the coat he leant the princess.
- The princess clearly seems to be developing some feelings for Grey.
- 
Things start to look hopeful as they come across signs of civilization!
- however Grey seems to doubt that he'll be able to make it, and instructs the princess how to find the rest of her way just in case.
## Dur'zoga's Dream
She's in a field, having completed her farming work and training for the day.
She catches some other kids snickering at her, so she slings a rock at em'.
They walk up to pick a fight, calling her half blood.
She fucking nails one of them in their good eye with a rock, at which point they start threatening her, calling her mother a whore, etc.
They seem to be goading her into making the first attack, though notably not many of them seem willing to actually fight.
She of course, wipes the floor with the brats, and those that can, scamper off.

## Cello's Dream
Cello awakens in the [[Oracle tea house]]. (The tea and bath house in the [[Sanctified District]])
She is having tea, with her mistress. They're reviewing their latest performance.
- Someone dared to launch a tomato at her mistress during a mistake in their performance due to Cello being slightly out of pace. Her mistress seems chill about it, despite having to improvise due to forgetting the remainder of their lines for the sequence due to the disruptions.
	- Ironically enough, it inspired a more interesting direction for the story.
	- That of the story of a one sided love, of someone giving love to a being that is incapable of giving it back. Clearly meant to be analogous to the story of Cello and her Mistress.
## Morning comes.
A middle bell chimes, indicating an eldritch moon is occurring the following night.
Waron recalls that there are 3 different types of bells:
- A low guttural bell tone, indicating an eldritch moon has ended, and rung to indicate deaths of important figures in the city. (AKA, the [[Death bell]])
- A middle bell, known as [[Victoria's bell]], formerly known as the [[Kings bell]] back during the first war. Now they are known as a warning that an eldritch moon will occur the next night.
- A high bell, AKA the [[Radiant Bell]] known for casting a radiant glow across the city. It's rung to indicate success, or reconstruction efforts completing in some area of the city.

The crew gets some coffee to start the day (aside from Waron)

Marinus meets up with Henry (The blood cross member).
- Verena tags along
Marinus convinces Henry to tag along with us to the [[Shrouded District]] later in the day.

Verena asks Marinus to keep her name away from the members of the blood cross for her safety, and that of the group.

## Waron seeks out Ludwig
Ah shit, with the up coming eldritch moon he might be hard to get ahold of...

Happens to find Ludwig outside his chambers, speaking with [[Thokk]] and [[Cona]].
He requests to speak one on one with Ludwig, notably without proper titles being included.
- Asks what the name Gerard means to to him, to get his attention for a private conversation.
Waron informs Ludwig of his recent vision like dreams, to which Ludwig protests that since Waron is a scourge borne, he shouldn't have any memories of his life prior to becoming a scourge...
- Seems heavily suspect of Waron, even going so far as to pin him against a wall by his neck with one arm at the mention of Leah's name.
He ends up kicking Waron out, without answering much of anything, seemingly wanting to, but being held back by... something.
- presumably his "oath".

After leaving Ludwig's chambers, he heads out to meet his party, but is met by some other members of the Eldritch hunt, who recognize that he seems bothered by something.
- [[Geiger]]
- one of the recruits Waron saved (NEEDS VIDEO REVIEW)
Waron meets up with the party outside [[The Silver Wolf]]
### Waron history check knowledge: 
The first Hunt happened in the year 1011, it's the 1014 currently.
There has been 51 hunts so far, with the 52nd being tomorrow night.
The infamous hunt, aka hunt 33.
- started the major prep for hunts.
- Up until this one, the Jaegers alone where sufficient.
> [!note] The above needs to go into some LORE notes!
