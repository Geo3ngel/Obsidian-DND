## Marius's dream
He's in the middle of some sort of territorial dispute between massive moon scale entities.
Some large eye like creature appears first, searching for him throughout the city... When it spots him, and begins to draw him in, another being appears to pull him through his void, in the opposite direction. The other being begins to flee in it's presence.

The void like moon being instructs him to "Prevent emptiness".
> [!question] Is the eye like being from the silver tonic, in association with the church?
> It appears to be inferior to whatever void like being backs Marinus.

## Waron dreams of [[The founding of the Paladins of the Eldritch Hunt]]
Waron awakens to anxiety, next to a young Ludwig in a wear house by a bleeding werewolf 
**Date**: 2nd of Altruac 1011 A.E. 

He was pinned down a bit, and Waron got the killing blow
- it didn't die until we used the church's holy water, despite stabbing it in the heart, cutting it's intestines, etc...
The church wanted to ensure some form of loyalty...
- So they had us swear an oath to the church and people of Luyarnha.
- Ludwig didn't seem to suspect to much about taking the oath at the time. Quote "Oaths are just words you speak out loud and pretend to  care about."
Ludwig told them we drink the blood of our enemies as a ritual of sorts...
- This is totally how the paladins of the eldritch hunt contracted the scourge, isn't it? As part of their initiation ritual, they're made to drink blood due to Ludwig's edginess.

## Grey's Dream
Grey dreams of his survival with [[Princess Lightshard]] in the wilderness.

He enters his dream foraging for food, as he happens upon some quail eggs.

Things are starting to get rather dire, as they're on their last set of rations, and Grey has been giving more to the princess. As a result, he starts to feel his hunger eating away at his energy reserves steadily.

Upon his return, he and the princess banter back and forth while sharing their morning meal.

They playfully assert new nicknames for one another, as Queen Ruby of the broken cloaks, and Captain Grey. Grey being named after the color of the cloak he leant the princess.
- The princess clearly seems to be developing some feelings for Grey.

Things start to look hopeful as they come across signs of civilization!
- however Grey seems to doubt that he'll be able to make it (he's starting to feel the lack of food from travel, since most of the rations have gone to the princess thus far to ensure her health), and instructs the princess how to find the rest of her way just in case, as Grey finds himself awakening from his slumber...
## Dur'zoga's Dream
She's in a field, having completed her farming work and training for the day.
- Notably she's getting quite good with an Axe and other armaments as the days pass.
She catches some other kids snickering at her, seemingly making fun of her seeing her work the soil, and being of half orc blood. So she slings a rock at em'.

They walk up to pick a fight, calling her half blood directly this time.

She fucking nails the leader of the group *in their good eye* with a rock, at which point they start threatening her, calling her mother a whore, etc.
They seem to be goading her into making the first attack, though notably not many of them seem willing to actually fight.
She of course, wipes the floor with the brats, and those that are still able to, scamper off while shouting about how she'll pay for bringing them harm.

## Cello's Dream
Cello awakens in the [[Oracle tea house]]. (The tea and bath house in the [[Sanctified District]])
She is having tea, with her mistress as they reviewing their latest performance.

Someone dared to launch a tomato at her mistress during a mistake in their performance due to Cello being slightly out of pace. Her mistress seems chill about it, despite having to improvise due to forgetting the remainder of her lines for the sequence due to the disruption.
- Ironically enough, this ended up inspiring a more interesting direction for the story.
- That of the story of a one sided love, of someone giving love to a being that is incapable of giving it back. 
	- Clearly meant to be analogous to the story of Cello and her Mistress.
## Morning comes.
A middle bell chimes, indicating an eldritch moon is occurring the following night.

Waron rolls well for history, recalling that there are 3 different types of bells:
- A low guttural bell tone, indicating an eldritch moon has ended, and rung to indicate deaths of important figures in the city. (AKA, the [[Death Bell]])
- A middle bell, known as [[Victoria's Bell]], formerly known as the [[Kings Bell]] back during the first war. Now they are known as a warning that an eldritch moon will occur the next night.
- A high bell, AKA the [[Radiant Bell]] known for casting a radiant glow across the city. It's rung to indicate success, or reconstruction efforts completing in some area of the city.

As such, the chime heard was that of a [[Victoria's Bell]], indicating the group will need to prepare for the coming eldritch moon.

The crew gets some coffee to start the day (aside from Waron)

Marinus meets up with Henry (The blood cross member).
- Verena tags along
Marinus convinces Henry that all is well between him and the blood cross at present, and even manages to get him to tag along with us to the [[Shrouded District]] later in the day for our investigation of the meat processing plant.
- Henry then takes his leave for the time being.

Verena then (privately) asks Marinus to keep her name away from the members of the blood cross for her safety, and for that of the group.

## Waron seeks out Ludwig
After rolling out of bed, troubled about the frequency of the visions he's been having over the last 48 hours that seem to be memories rather than dreams, he decides to confront Ludwig on the matter. He has been in most of them after all.

Upon seeking him out, he happens to find Ludwig outside his chambers speaking with [[Thokk]] and [[Cona]].

He requests to speak one on one with Ludwig, notably without proper titles being included. (Which seems to piss off [[Cona]])
- Asks what the name Gerard means to to him, to get his attention for a private conversation.
Waron informs Ludwig of his recent vision like dreams, to which Ludwig protests that since Waron is a scourge borne, he shouldn't have any memories of his life prior to becoming a scourge.

He insists that what matters isn't the past, but who Waron is now. As a member of the pack.

When Waron pushes further though, and brings up Leah, he gets very aggressive...
- Seems heavily suspect of Waron, even going so far as to pin him against a wall by his neck with one arm at the mention of Leah's name.
He ends up kicking Waron out, without answering much of anything, seemingly wanting to after Waron apologizes for thrusting something so ridiculous upon him the night before a hunt, but it Ludwig is clearly held back by... something.
- presumably his "oath" to the church.

After leaving Ludwig's chambers, he heads out to meet his party, but is met by some other members of the Eldritch hunt, who recognize that he seems bothered by something.
- [[Geiger]] prods him, believing his worry is about the upcoming hunt
- One of the recruits Waron saved also seems to notice, and wishes him well.
- [[Atriox]] also senses something is disturbing Waron, though Waron brushes it off as nothing and exits promptly.
Waron meets up with the party outside [[The Silver Wolf]].

Upon Waron notifying the group about the bell chime's meaning, **Verena** questions if the frequency of the hunts has been increasing, citing the last moon we'd survived was mere days ago.
- history checks ensue to recall relevant info about the frequency of eldritch moons occurring.
### Waron history check knowledge: 
The first Hunt happened in the year 1011, it's the 1014 currently.
There has been 51 hunts so far, with the 52nd being tomorrow night.
He's also aware of the infamous hunt, aka hunt 33.
- Started the major prep for hunts.
- Up until this hunt, the Jaegers alone where sufficient apparently. Indicating that not only are they possibly becoming more frequent, but require more resources due to increasing in intensity as well.
> [!note] The above needs to go into some LORE notes!

The group then heads out for the gates of the [[Shrouded District]], and that is where the session ends...
