1. Session 09 - The One With Shopping and Audio Issues
  
The session opens to the party in the Golden Hals around mid morning. Durzhoga looks for weapons. She heads to the SIlver Wolf which has heavy production of melee weapons. She asks for javelins and hand axes, which all have some sort of wolf like structural components. She gets non silvered hand axes and javelins. Adriox prices them at “6-7 Claws' ' per javelin and “5 Teeth”' per hand axe. He tries to suggest that Durzhoga does some mercenary work, possibly for the Paladins. Narisssa clear her throat loudly. The party leaves after Adriox asks Durzhoga to look after Waron. Outside, Narissa warns Durzhoga about religious mercenaries always working an angle before suggesting they go to the Tripple IDE.Gray looks for a social gathering in a tavern (Heaven’s Hospice) and finds a grieving woman who is mourning her son. A man tried to comfort him. A seven foot tall and graceful woman with platinum hair is wiping down a table (an Aasimar). She comforts the woman, saying that her son’s sacrifice was worth it. The man mutters “fucking silverbloods” and about how royal blood has cursed these lands. The man storms away. Gray gives the woman a gold piece, and Aasimar looks at him in recognition. But Gray does not recognize her.

Everyone heads to the Triple IDE, Cello donation fund. Cello tries to refuse saying that they don’t want to be a bother to anyone. “You’ll be a bother if you die on us darling.” Narissa replies. She then replies that alternatively they could just loot more bodies since they;re not using thier weapons. “And neither are their families” Waron comments dejectedly. Narissa further proposes that they could add silver to Cello’s lyre as a reinforcement. They make their way to the Triple IDE and a Dwarven man with a rifle stock leg opening the door. A series of terribly inefficient and engineering garbage has been constructed into a gear system to open a heavy door. On a board are the prices of bullets.

The dwarf’s name is Randolph Ironhands. He has a lantern and scythe that can trap souls that the scythe slays. And if you call upon the souls, they can smite enemies. Narissa proposes a scientific partnership as Gray asks the man about the morality of taking weapons from the dead considering family weapons. Cello wants a rapier with a gun. She bargains with Randolph to trade in her found sword for the rapier. He mentions the Jagermeister Program, but that its pretty secretive. “What's survival ?” Narissa asks. “Well the applicant number isn’t public but all the Jagermeister past and there's about 100, so 100%. “ Randolph says. “Wow, that's better than our recruitment survival.” chimes Waron. “Yeah well that’s what happens when you only report the survivors.” Narissa replies. “That’s good isn’t it?” Waron asks. NArissa stares at him unbelievingly “Waron, have you heard of fractions?” Waron frowns and asks “Like the things you break?” . It would seem like math was not a subject taught in Luyarnha public schools.

Concluding their shopping, the party searches for a magic shop and see three. One is Mother Lugru which has a black cultish look. A Blood spattered sign advertises “The Sanctified Sinner”, and screams come from the building. Further, it states that it is sponsored by House of Blood. Finally, there is a shop that seems like a cozy cushy library called The Enlightened Scholar which issSponsored by the Luminary Scribe. After Narissa lists them off, Verina gets a sensation that someone is watching her but sees nothing. Verena notices a small church-like structure in the corner there blocking light and masking a shop with a sign with squirming “Etchings of the Arcane ''. A cold sensation percolates on her skin and she begins to walk towards it without a word. “Young Lady, just where do you think you’re going?” Marinus calls after her. No one else can read the chicken scratch like sign. Verena goes in. Verena meets a strange Ironmaiden like person. She has some trouble focusing in the “library”. Is called the Penetant (lost name in the Unaming). It is revealed that the ironmaden person was perhaps involved in Osteomancy. They further reveal that Osteomancy individuals are incarcerated and unchained / broken from the arcane and let go. So it's a punishment to stop these individuals from exploring osteomancy and the dangers that it accompanies. Verena sees some sheets with details on how to alter one's body with tattoos. She would purchase tattoos. The Penitent mentions that she has the Sight, and that someone has been prophesied since people with the Sight do not come from Luyarnha.

In the Enlightened Scholar the rest of the party meet an off peacock eyed thing named Desmis who sees the future. Within the shop they find magical scroll, color coordinated inks and papers, magical journals, a scroll of Mapping for 25 gp. Narissa asks for a catalog of known creatures in Luyarnha Waron and Marinus find a daylight spell 3rd level (500 gp) one time use. Varena rejoins the party and asks Nariss if she’s interested in magical tattoos that turn your blood into bullets. Narissa asks if they could use this to turn other creatures that have been hunted into bullets. This comment causes Desmis to send her assistant Millie to go get the Militia. She believes that the party is involved in Osteomancy. Once Verena mentions that she's a Harro, this causes Desmiss to bow and suddenly realize that she has made a big mistake.

The Militia shows up demanding to know who the party is . They are absolute ASSHOLES. Specifically, a half orc and elf and human are rude to Verena, saying that her family means nothing. After a stand off and many snide comments, the men leave. Millie tells them that the human who was a dick is Benny and that he had just lost his brother the night before. Narissa had raided his body for bullets the previous night unbeknownst to her. Dismiss , embarrassed, reveals that the problem was that Narissa caused her to call them. As a Tiefling she was already suspicious but with her discussing tattoos of an arcane nature such as using them to convert creatures blood into bullets is Heresy outside of the Jeagers. Waron and Narissa press Desmiss into giving them the Daylight spell for 300 gp. The party leaves and the Enlightened Scholar puts up a “Closed” sign.
