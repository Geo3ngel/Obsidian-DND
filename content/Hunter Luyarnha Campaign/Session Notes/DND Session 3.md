The session opens with everyone standing just inside the outer wall of Luyarnha. Standing there, everyone feels an intense sense of paranoia and slight fear as they stand there inside the city. Waron awakes and notices that the moon is indicative of a Shattered Hunt. But more importantly he realizes that this is almost a moon of rebirth of things that are reborn. It is called a “Geisnatch moon” or a shattered moon. The entire defensive team guarding the grand cathedral surrounds them. The party overhear them saying “There was a back up plan for this. Plan was for the …” and “Geisnatch moon affects spiritual plane + draws in bad spirits. Doesn't bode well for anyone without weapons that gleam in the moonlight.”

Verena stumbles faintly as if overwhelmed by something. She gains an empathic connection to the people around her. For the next hour is able to empathically sense those around her. Waron suggests that they try to get to the Grand Cathedral, one of the only truly safe places during an Eldritch Moon. Grey suggests that they do a beast rodeo and tame some of the beasts outside and ride them to the Cathedral. Dur’zoga sees a beautiful woman descending with beasts and shadows around her. Everyone hears a melody and stand, prepared to fight them. However, Cello helps 2 of the spirits (Geists) move on after countering the melody with a harmonized song. Verena joins in with a fifth and manages to free the other two spirits. Cello manages to sing more beautifully and free the final ghost lady. Suddenly, a mountain of visage tar begins to break through behind them.

Outside, there are lots of plants and ivy life. The party runs through the streets until they hear gunshots and run towards it. They find a crazy five o’clock shadow bullet smith country man just shooting up spirits with a shotgun. He seems almost to be doing skeet shooting with them. He introduces himself as Hugo Magmabrant and he is the owner of “Powdered Emporium '', a local gun shop. He ushers them inside after he shoots off a few most geists and closes the door. The shop is a silver lined room. The shop is stacked with various guns and barrels of bullets. Lead (1 per each round),, pure silver (30 for 10), armor piercing (80 for 10), laceration (60 for 10) and explosive (40 for 10 )bullets , reinforced ash wood (10 for 10). He starts talking about the “Emberhearts, Silverbloods, and Moongolds.” They are the three biggest rich families that have been trying to run any good gunsmith out of business by out producing them (Amazon style). Of note a rifle = 70 “shimmers” aka gold (?). A Gauntlet + stake driver “The stake driver”. A hammer + furnace “Boom Hammer” 35 shimmers. A Spear + rifle - The Riffle Spear.

Hugo checks Durzoga, Gray and Daul’s eyes. A blue glimmer in the right eye means that they have been marked by a lunar reverence. Durzouga convinces Hugo to let them spend the night in his shop + Waron offers to broker an arms deal with the Paladin of the Eldritch Hunt for future supplies. Everyone falls asleep in various areas of the shop.
