## [[Dur'zoga]]'s Trance
The scene opens to her as a child, being accosted by the father of one of the children she hit with a rock in her prior dream sequence.
- Apparently they've been waiting for a reason to kick her out of the village, and can no longer tolerate her presence in the village upon her attacking the other village children.
She runs forward towards the man, presumably to attack him.

*Fwoom*, Verena pops into Dur'zoga's mind in an attempt to break her out of her maddening state.
She tackles Dur'zoga from behind to stop her in her tracks

The mob begins to move forward, towards Dur'zoga and Verena.
Dur'zoga attempts to appeal to the mob, asserting words hurt as well, and that she was defending herself.

However, it was to no avail, the mob takes a torch to her home, lighting it on fire.
- they angrily assert that they would never take something from those who begged to be let into the village to begin with, but that she is not entitled to anything within.
- They aim to make clear that she is not welcome, and force her to leave
- Some villagers even attack her directly.
The boy stops for a moment, staring at the home, now burning.
- He slips out of his father's grasp, and runs towards the house.
- He throws open the door, and enters inside, and begins patting around for something, apparently this isn't his first time there?
- He used to be inside her home regularly apparently, that she hadn't remembered.
- He retrieves some small box, hidden in a crevasse in some boards
- Suffocating in the smoke, and hands now burned, he finds Dur'zoga inside, and forces the green emerald gemstone from within the box upon Dur'zoga, with a slight smile.
- Then proceeds to drag her out of the house.
His father then scolds him for saving her from the burning home.

Verena appears somewhat satisfied by what she has seen, and informs Dur'zoga that we need her.
Strength is not how quick, or how strong you are, but how many times you can get back up
