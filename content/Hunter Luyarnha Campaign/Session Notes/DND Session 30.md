# Session Intro
---
We all had our dream sequences last night
Waron notified the group of the ringing of Victoria's bell.
We're headed to the shrouded district to begin investigating the meat processing plant.
- we're arriving at the gate to the shrouded district.
The coming moon is a [[Glouring Moon]]

# Session Notes
---
We're approaching the gate with [[Bloody Henry]].

We arrive at the meat processing plant without much trouble...
- it seems to be more of a brewery...?
