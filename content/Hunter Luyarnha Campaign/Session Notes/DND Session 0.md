# [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Locations/Beast Lands/Beastland’s Train Station]]
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Verena]]
> [!info] The scene opens to Verena pulling into Beastland’s Train Station at dusk in a coach. 

The train station is dark, misty and has a few guards patrolling the desolate station. 
She asks a beast-like looking conductor with a pocket watch what time is. 

His breath smelling like cigarettes and with his grizzled beastly demeanor, he tells her that it’s about 8 o’clock but that the train will “arrive exactly when it's supposed to.” Followed by the train’s horn sounding through the fog, appearing lopsided and heavily armored with a heavily scratched exterior. 

There are **four coaches** that accompany the battered locomotive.
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Cello]]
[[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Cello]] leaves the train upon it's arrival at the station (seemingly the only one on board)

Cello approaches the conductor to ask him where they are to which he replies “[[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Locations/Beast Lands/Beastland’s Train Station]]. The only stop is [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Locations/Luyarnha/Luyarnha]]". 

Cello asks how they got there but is greeted by an intense pain in their head. They go to sit next to a red haired noble looking lady (Verena).
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Marinus]]
In the meantime, Marinus wakes up from the abyss that was his sleep to see the train arrive. 

Marinus makes his way to the disheveled and grimy ticket booth, disrupting a cacophony of roaches and gnats. Marinus conjures a small blackhole near the tickets behind the sleeping and grungy ticket man. 

The black hole almost wakes up the sleeping man before Marinus manages to move the roll of tea stained looking tickets to the counter before taking one. 

He gives his ticket to the grungy looking conductor, who adds a skull looking punch-out to the ticket. 

The conductor warns him that any who go to Luyarnha ends up becoming a person who ends up going mad.
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Narissa]]
Narissa emerges from the woods of the [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Locations/Beast Lands/Beastland]]'s to the train station after having walked for hours through the dangerous terrain. 

Noting the full moon, she puts three silver bullets in her pistol before making her way to the ticket booth. 

She steals two tickets from the roll that Marinus had left before making her way to the conductor. He takes a good look at her as he takes her ticket. 

“By the looks of you, you could do a great deal in Luyarnha.” He says as he punches her ticket with a skull hole punch. “Oh you have no idea.” She responds as she boards the train. “It’s your funeral.” He replies.
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Da'ul]]
Da’ul emerges from the woods with a walking stick and approaches the front desk to see the still sleeping grizzled man. 

Da’ul knocks on the counter and wakes up the man. Da’ul trades his knife for a ticket, to which the salesman chuckles at.

“You’re gonna trade your best weapon of defense for a ticket to go into the most dangerous place on this side of the continent? Your funeral.” 
Da'ul replies that he has research to complete before he boards the train.

## Remaining characters at the station attempt to board:
Verena asks Cello if they are going to get on the train. In the conversation, Cello reveals that she is from Luyarnha and that she needs to get back to her mistress. 

### Verena boards
Verena hands her ticket to the conductor who punches her ticket with a skull, who says that she looks like she’s running from something. 

“Maybe I am running towards something. Have you ever thought about that?” “You smell too nice to be running towards something.”He punches her ticket and as she boards she looks over her shoulder and says. “I’m looking for something.” “Hope you find it, but it’s your funeral.” The conductor says before Verena boards.

### Cello boards
Cello tries to board the train and the conductor stops her. 

“You really wanna go back there after I saved your life? You’re the last thing I’ve seen come out of there alive in 5 fucking years.”

“But I need to get back to my mistress.” The man begrudgingly lets her board. 
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Dur'zoga]]
Dur’zoga gets to the platform and makes his way to the ticket counter and flicks a coin onto the counter when prompted. 

She hands her ticket to the conductor, who looks confused and slightly with fear.  

He looks away and she snaps her fingers and asks him if the train is heading to Luyarnha. He gives her a brief answer before she boards the train.
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Grey]]
Grey is running through the trees, presumably running from someone hunting him, and comes across the train. 

He drinks something from his flask and gets onto the train offering some to the conductor. “I hear people who have death wishes heading to Luyarnha don’t need tickets.” Grey says. The conductor laughs and takes a swig. He boards the train.

# Inside the Train
## Entrance: [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Player Characters/Waron/Waron]]
Waron was guarding a nobility like dining coach, to which the only passenger was an automaton that responded to nothing. 

He is confused when so many colorful characters board the train including the automaton who had arrived. He approaches her again to try and interact with her. 

“I see you’re back Ms. Ceramic. And with some friends this time. Would you like some drinks?’
“Have you met me before?”

“Well I suppose that depends. I did see you on the train but you weren’t very talkative. I even resorted to my helmet story.” Waron says. 

Cello tries to recall any sort of memory prior to her arriving at Beastland Station but is greeted with intense pain once more. Cello, confused, sits down at one of the empty leather booths. 

# Characters board the train (Inside perspective)
Marinus boards the train and makes his way to the bar cat, grabbing a bottle of scotch before sitting down. 

Narissa walks down the length of the cart, noting that Waron is a paladin that serves the Radiant Church. 

With a smirk, she makes her way to the bar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey and begins cleaning her gun. 

Verena sits next to Narissa, commenting on the gun. The two exchange pleasantries and shake hands, to which Narissa note’s the intricate and arcane in nature tattoos that cover Verena’s hands in addition to a fair amount of scars.

“And what are you doing in Luyarnha?” Verena asks her. “Monster hunting of course, darling.” Narissa spreads her arms wide to reveal her guns and various monster hunting attire.

Da'ul boards the train and instantly sits down need the entrance of the cart, seeming somewhat overwhelmed to a degree by the interior. 

Shortly after Dur’zoga enters and makes her way to the back of the cart, watching the exchange between Narissa and Verena. “And what are you doing in Luyarnha?” Narissa asks Verena. 

“Looking for someone.” She replies. “It must be one heck of a person to be lost in Luyarnha.” “You could say it was for a job.” “Is it terminal?” “Not quite.” 

At this point, Grey enters the train, his hood up to obscure his features and he sits across from Da'ul, seemingly trying to keep a low profile. 

In asking Waron if things are as bad as they seem in Luyarnha, Waron informs Verena and Narissa that things aren’t “that bad.” “I’d say the survival rate is about 50%.” He tells them honestly and in an unconcerned manner. 

He also tells them that the train is frequently attacked, which is why he has been sent to help protect the passengers. He remarks that the lot of them look very prepared, something he hasn’t seen before.
