Session 13-Clue ? 
Making the way to Central Park - where weird things had been seen. They come to the garden, filled with about 10 lounging individuals. The party split up and look for clues. Marinus finds hoofprints which he follows. Narissa smells sulfur, a sign that the Dullahan had been there within 24 hrs. Dur'zoga spots a trail of dark blood, which smells humanoid. Marinus notices that people are avoiding certain areas, specifically the train surrounding the base of a central tree. Cello recalls that a crazy man used to yell about how he could speak to the trees, but that he was put in an asylum Narissa recalls : coincidental, collaborated, and conditional (how entities are created). Dullahan carry souls that are harvested from dead bodies in a way that leaves them beheaded and dissatisfied. Different types of Dullahan can traverse in different ways using trinkets that tie them to the plan of existence in a summoning fashion. Using the trinquet, the Dullahan is summoned and does the bidding. Marinus notices that the hoof prints end in at the base of the tree. He then states “the horse is in the tree. We should burn down the tree.”

“Careful or they’ll drag you to an insane asylum.” “Isn’t Luyarnha already an insane asylum?.” Narissa sees that blood runs up to a spot three feet up on the trunk. She licks the blood and determines that it is the blood of a newborn human baby (a type of blood that the Shaw Family refused to regularly sample ). She tells Waron to follow the trail black to where it came from. They come to the Quilandros Manor. They spot a Yeager and Hunters outside the manor. The Yeager, a tall woman with dark eyes ,approaches them. They inform her that they were there on behalf of Vicar Abraham and that Detective Morales sent them. They ask to see Detective Dominic, she somewhat passive aggressively does so and brings them into the seemingly untouched from the scene of a crime: the Quilandros Manor. Marinus spots the imprints of hoofprints throughout the main hallway of the house. They make their way past a statue of a shirtless man wrestling with a dragon before they make their way into a large kitchen. Inside, an untouched luxurious meal accompanies the headless corpse of what seems to be a young woman. A unkempt and tired looking man nonchalantly looks over the body while he smokes a cigar. He introduces himself as Detective Dominic who informs them that the Dullahan entered the house with no resistance (the doors were unlocked) before it seemed to have targeted a female servant. The Dullahan chopped her head off, collected it, before it reached inside her body as if looking for something. He also reveals that her womb seems to be missing; Marinus postulates that she may have been pregnant. He reveals that Philip seemed unmoved by the occurrence due to his new financial problems. He had invested with both the Moon Golds and Ember Hearts before he started pulling his money from them and putting it towards a new cause : alchemy. Marinus follows the blood trail.

Narissa tastes the blood of the two wounds on the body : the blood is human, but the wound to the abdomen tastes different. She pats down the body and finds a moonstone bracelet on the girl’s wrist that says “always here - T”. Narissa tries to pinpoint the source of the difference in blood tastes in a vulgar manner as she fingers the corpse and tastes the blood. Narissa notices the stomach is torn, the uterus is missing, and her appendix is missing. Three suspects : Vanessa Quilandros, Tanya Cicada, and Philip Quilandros

Marinus comes across Vanessa, who mistakes him for the detective that is there to get her alibi. He takes out his burnt notebook. She states that she was dealing with the bank following Lord Quilandros moving the family’s fund from the Emberheart and Moon Golds to Alchemical Design and Research. She also states that it wouldn’t be out of character for her husband to kill the maid; he hasn’t been sleeping well due to trying to manage their family’s funds. He notices the blood leads to a closet and designs to entertain Vanessa until more people arrive. She reveals that the witness made is a harley from the “Dreamer’s Den” and that the one that died was from the street to replace a maid that had left due to “unfit conditions”. She also proceeds to spill that the Tanya is trying to black

-mail the family with Philip’s affair with the dead maid.

Tanya’s Tale - Lena (the victim) and Tanya were prepping the meal. Lena seemed excited about the meal, as she was going to surprise Lord Quilandros with something. She reveals that Lena and Philip were close (they had known each other prior to her employment). She states that Lena seemed like she was developing feelings for him. Tanya doesn’t believe that Philip would have done anything to Lena. She reports that in the last few weeks, the two had been speaking a lot and that Lena had seemed hopeful and excited about something. The doors unlocked and a rider on a steed made of wood, the rider's head sitting on its waist. The rider targeted Leana. She also reveals that she thought Lena was pregnant.

After being interrogated by Marinus, Grey, and Waron, Vanessa admits to having an affair with Galeo (a handsome man) and she has to meet him tonight to “destress”. She is very stressed. Waron senses envy within Venessa, like she knew she wasn't enough for something. Poltergeists spawned by a scorned ex lover . Spectral entities have trouble finding their targets. They get messy. Sloppy Dullahan . Envious murder intent. SOMETHING IS COMING FUCK WE WENT AFTER THE WRONG GUY.
