# Session Prep
---
I need to figure out how to add my armor modifications on!
And add that amulet to my inventory!

## Things to do address this session:
#### Visiting the [[Sanctified Sinner]] to address the issue of my blood being in their possession.
- Marinus seems convinced we could talk it out
- Narissa & Verena are super concerned.
#### Prep for the Eldritch moon!
We need to see if we can find more allies for the hunt
- Maybe try getting the paladins of the eldritch hunt to help out?
- See if anyone else is willing to assist? (Who? Literally who?)
