The Vicor has answers..?

Waron would like to check out the room

Marinus discovers a Strange statue that appears to be an amalgamation of bones of different races, with a Tiefling skull floating in the air at the top (6ft off the ground)

He calls Verena over to check it out.

She obliges, but upon viewing the skull, she hears something... from within. Still somewhat alive, or perhaps not quite dead? Somewhere in-between life and death, as Hunter puts it.

Marinus attempts to dissuade Henry from attacking Verena, as she goes to grab the skull.
- He succeeds

She gets a vision from the perspective of Vargus, brother of the Victor.

Vargus volunteers for something, Vicor Henry is proud, and leads him there.
- Vicor Henry is the evil one from the one shot, that is secretly some monster? 
Thomathin is also involved, amongst the nobles involved in this process.

Some form of experiment is wrought upon Vargus. It hurts. He loses himself, begins comiting murder. A lot of murder.
- on the behalf of who?
Then he hears a voice, instructing him to build... something. Preparing for "their" coming...
He sings a pure song, which makes a strange fluid drip from his mouth.

**The vision ends.**

Verena succeeds a wisdom saving throw, to successfully pull away from the skull. The vision occurring in but an instant.
- It appears from the vision, that he was in some sort of prison... now affiliated with the church, but another faction?

Supposedly, Vargus was the Candle butcher monster.
He was building the bone alter thing here?

## Legend of the Frist Jaeger Born
JÃ¤germeister Steinhardt
A being that single handedly flipped the losing war against the beasts trying to attack the city.

He disappeared trying to find answers within the sewers of the Ruby district.

Henry is trying to convince the group that we've stopped whatever this was. As though he's trying to distract us from the idea of a higher group responsible for this... place.

Verena asserts to Henry that she is trying to do her best to protect the people of this city. And that's something they have in common, to try and win him over here.
- He seems to know something...

He removes his glasses, showing the drawn out lines on his worn face.
- He holds his tongue. He in some way appears to know that Verena is correct.

Waron questions if we're going to destroy the skull and totem, or leave them be
Henry moves to fire at the skull, but his gun misfires. He angrily storms off.

Waron grabs the tiefling skull from the totem, after having smashed it with his mace form Scythe

Man I'm really not a fan of these baths yall are so fond of...

Marinus discovers a [[Damascena]] in a fat Berge adjacent to the pathway out.

### End of session encounter
After emerging from the sewers and heading across the shrouded district to Thomathin's place to give a report.
When they come across some men in black cloaks, that catch a skinned scourge beast
