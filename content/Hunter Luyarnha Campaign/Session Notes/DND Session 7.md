Marinus is the first to wake up in a Church made Hospital. He meets a member of the Blood Cross who appears pale, like she has rarely seen the sun like many of her order. She gives Marinus a silver tonic (it will cure ailments thought to be incurable). She states it won't heal all, but that normally only those within the Blood Cross get these but she is giving it to him in good conscience for the work the party did defending the Grand Catedral. She further reveals that everyone in the order has taken it. Marinus drinks the silver tonic that she administers to him, saying an incantation as she does so. Flow through your veins soothing your wounds and kindling your spirit.Marinus is able to translate through a spell. It tastes like an un-bubbly La Croix and he heals 30 HP. Everyone wakes up in hospital.They awake to see one another together with a well armed individual watching them in hunter style garments. They wear the symbol of the Hunter (the militia of the Church). Other occupants are patients who appear to have been injured such as those affected by the skurge born. Narissa says that she wants to find some more exploding bullets and voices that she wants to go loot more bodies. Marinus groans and states “There must be some law here.” Waron tells her to maybe keep the discussion to a minimum regarding the “looting of his former friends. There’s a time and a place.” Narissa nods and starts to whisper her desire to go loot bodies. Waron shakes his head.

Cello and Verena awake. Verena notices that her tattoo has changed slightly and that one of the petals on her flowers seems to flutter across her skin. Cello notices glass window panes depicting the history of a Church from the rise of the Godless King, to the rise of the skurge, to a shattered pane and finally to the Radiant Ones themselves. The Godless king looks on to a figure of a member being crucified. A half orc militia man tells them that they have been placed under watch due to the Vicar Abraham, the apostle to Lugarius wanting to talk to them. Durzhoga appears to be much stronger and built, she can ever pick up her great axe with only one hand. Durzhoga and Waron apologize in tandem at opposite sides of the room. The party makes their way out of the hospital to find them in the equivalent of an enclosed bazaar. A city/residential area within the church bustling with many women and children. The militia man tells them that the Golden Halls on the second floor is where the Eldritch Hunt resides. The party comes across robbed figures with scholar's caps carrying massive tomes.

The party is called stragglers and invaders by the militia men. They walk into a large hall like an office with a man working on lots of scrolls. He looks like a weathered leader with robes with leather armor but in the colors of the Radiant Church. He states, annoyed, that a member of the Eldritch Hunt (Waron) was allowed to stand guard on a train outside of the Church. He begins to berate Waron until Narissa speaks up and says that really it was “God’s work and all that'' that Waron was on the train since he helped stop the monsters on the train. Vicar Abraham writes down their tale, unfazed until she brings up the Wendigo. He tells them a reward is in order since the party had no ill intent and rather helped in the Eldritch Hunt. Waron and Narissa high five without looking and he whispers “See, sometimes you get things for doing good. You don’t always have to steal.” “Yeah but that way it's easier.” she whispers back. Cello precedes to hide her sword.

Verena introduces herself as Verena Haro, and the Vicar recognizes her. He states that he wasn’t prepared for a visit from a member of the Haro family given their lock down. When she mentions that she isn’t here on visit, he relaxes. He states that the Liminere Repository could be used for knowledge from the public sector should she require it. He also says that there is a housing unit in the Ministry of Light. However, it only has space for two people. Abraham mentions that other districts fell last night and Cello raises their hand to clarify which districts fell and if the Sanctified District fell. He recognizes Cello as a past audience member to Cello and their Mistress Minerva. Cello asks if her Mistress is ok following a massacre in the Sanctified District. Cello desperately wishes to go back to the Sanctified District. Abraham gives them a writ of travel. Abraham states that other districts have fallen. But specifically, a Dullahan attacked in the Sanctified district and that a strange beast has compromised the aqueducts for the city. Narissa negotiates with Abraham to work with him in exchange for an additional 2 cot room for the party.

Prices of the jobs : Unknown beast at Paterna Eter - 8,000 GP . Dulahan for massacre in the Sanctified District - 4,000 GP

Narissa further negotiates to get a discount. Triple IDE discount should we mention TALK TO RANDOLF 10% discount on bulk purchase over 100 gp. “Like Costco” Says Grey. “Like what.” Abraham says “Oh yeah, they’ce got free samples.” Marinus says. Abraham directs them to the Heaven’s Hospice and Barracks of the Battle Chiefs for two taverns . Additionally, he pays the party a lump sum of 4000 GP (500 GP each). Cello’s pay is grabbed to fund them going back to the sanctified district.

The party goes to explore the Golden Halls in which each shop is a representative of their faction. For instance, the SIlver Wolf weapon’s shop is sponsored by the Eldritch Hunt. The party deliberate in an odd makeshift hallway. They decide to talk to Ludwig to gain insight on the Aqueduct. People stare at them with a mixture of sympathy for Cello, hared and reverence for Waron, and fear for Durzoga as well as disgust for Narissa.

Another Paladin recognizes Waron. A younger man whom Waron had recognized. His name is Initiate Jenson. The party makes their way to the Silver Wolf which contains lots of weapons. An excessively scraggly haired man with talons for nails and incisor like teeth greets them. He almost has a beast like nature that his body can’t contain him. His name is Adriox. He asks Waron if they are new initiates. Waron says he’s working on it to which Narissa says no. Waron pushes her away from their conversation. They ask for Ludwig and Adriox allows them upstairs to find him. Waron speaks to Ludwig, who is relieved that he is alive given the high casualties from the previous night. In asking about the aqueduct beast, Ludwig reveals that it is a complicated situation. The head of Offensive Combat and Intelligence, Kona, doesn’t want to assign anyone to the mission. This is partially in retaliation for Ludwig calling her and her team to the front lines the previous night. But what Ludwig does know is that creatures localize around aqueducts. Furthermore, Kona won’t tell Ludwig any additional information on what she found, due to her being pissed. However, Ludwig reveals that the beast is able to control the skurge born, something hasn’t been seen. It also seems intelligent. He tells them to seek out Lieutenant Paval. The party returns to the downstairs shop.

A scourgeborne with elk antlers and an elk skull comes in and is revealed to be Lieutenant Paval. He recounts what he knows about the beast : the tracks are not on all fours (like a wolf). This one lumbars as if its body is not symmetrical. One paw print was large compared to the others (one large arm). The furr burned in sunlight.
