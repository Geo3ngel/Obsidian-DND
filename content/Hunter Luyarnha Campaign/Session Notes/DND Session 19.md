# Session Intro
---
We're about to fight the [[cleric beast]] in [[Paterna Iter]]'s [[Water works]]

---
# Combat
---
I need to do my smite wombo combo if I can!
- Can I even cross through it with spectral slash?

Narissa did enough damage to have the beast proc it's healing move, bringing it out of it's wounded state
- used 2 legendary actions!

Waron pushed the beast into the black with a divine smite from his [[Church Pick]] into the void [[Marinus]] had created.

In response, the beast howled, and ripped it's arm off to escape the void
- used 2 legendary actions to escape the BS pinning it for several rounds lol.

The [[cleric beast]] called the group "Intruders".
Like, in common tongue.

He only said this audibly to [[Waron]] however, who at the time was deaf, though swears he could have read it's lips saying as such.

> [!error] INFO NEEDED HERE
> Missing details from combat prior to this point.
> Such as Marinus setting up his black hole, mind slivering, etc.

The beast lunges from the wall he was climbing to target Narissa, and instead attacks [[Dur'zoga]].

Narissa attempts to jump from one roof to anther (a solid 10ft gap) to get a better angle to fire from after the beast leap away to change target.
- But fails, and eats shit falling down the side of the building right in front of Waron.

[[Grey]] comes up with a plan mid battle, and offers to launch [[Cello]] on top of the beast, shouting to "Aim for the head".

She agrees, runs up, and is successfully launched into the air, landing atop the beast, stabbing at it and attempting to shoot it in the face point blank with her blunder buss in vain, as the bullets bounce off.

After some further scrapping with the beast, Grey seeing Cello struggle prompts him to try and climb up with beast *himself*. [The absolute mad lad]
And of course, succeeds, landing on the beasts head. He follows up by assisting Cello to gain a position on top of the beast's Head as well.

Upon being repositioned, Cello takes the opportunity to use the [[Scroll of Burning Hands]] she looted from one of the soaking corpses during [[DND Session 18]]'s 2 minute pre-boss battle planning phase, to burn the living shit out of the beast's skull.
- Flames erupting from the beast's eye sockets in response, it's life now dangling by a thread.

In a panic, the beast attempts to leap away from Dur'zoga and Waron. However, due to the weight of having 2 people atop it, and still having the afflictions applied from Narissa's [[Frozen Holy Water Bullet]] shot which halves it's movement, it's leap is halved twice. Resulting in a pitiful 10 foot leap away from Dur'zoga and Waron.
- Which it does twice in a row, in a desperate attempt to save it's life.

Upon witnessing Cello and Grey kick the absolute shit out of this now pitiful creature, Waron calmly walks up to the creature. Takes a heavy swing stand with his [[Church Pick]] in it's transformed state, and rends the beast in half at it's mid section to finish it off.

It's large hand appearing to try and crawl away to one of the nearby bodies, but Grey stabs it with his spear to stop it in it's tracks.

# After combat
---
Cello, having already somewhat cooked this creature's brain, decides to go in with her [[Battlechef Field Dresser (A)]] (chef knife), and carves out a steak from it's well done brain.
- Dur'zoga tries some, and somehow suffers zero consequences.

Waron's panting rather loudly after finishing off the beast, looking to be in rather rough shape.
- His blood lust threatened briefly to overtake him after the [[cleric beast]] was defeated.
- The voice of a woman seemed to bring him back.

Narissa then attempts to shoot Waron in the head. (With [[Blessed Rosaries]] to heal him)
He does not understand, and thus protests, despite the bullet already being spent. (clinked off the cheek of his helm)

Marinus heals Cello & Waron with his silvery tonic.

[[Narissa]] & [[Dur'zoga]] spot a shadowy wendigo looking figure looking down at us.
- Narissa shoots it of course, and is thrown into a brief hellish whirlwind of nightmares before snapping herself out of it.

[[Grey]] ties his hand to [[Waron]]'s since he's still deaf, and can't understand what every one is trying to do.
- Note, not a marriage ceremony.

The group find an intact green house nearby, within which they choose to take a short rest.

**The effects of madness fade**
- Waron gains his hearing back
- Grey loses his ability to shout to deal damage
- Narissa is tattooed with anti moon madness magic, so she's already fine.

After the hour or so of brief respite, a group of [[Corvian Dweller]]s lands in the area, and begins checking around. Scraping against the glass whilst peering in to see if they can spot any movement.
- Group stealth check ensues.
	- Thank God for 2 party member's Nat 20s, as others rolled somewhat poorly.
The creatures pause for a moment, before appearing to be scared off by a not too distant heavy thud.

The group, now left unbothered by the Corvian dwellers, seeks to deal with the problem of the bodies left in the water, fearing they will cause problems despite the purification runes put in place for the water works...
