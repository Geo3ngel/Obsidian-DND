Session opens with the party members still in the cart on the train, speeding ahead. Narissa notices “Emberheart ammunition” and “moongold munitions' 'were written on the cargo of gunpowder. Narissa recognizes the name Emberheart. Emberheart is a firearm manufacturing and arcane super weapon. They aren’t regarded as nobility but got to their position of power due to their blatant development of weapons of mass destruction. Logo is harsh in nature and is lacking in artistry. Verena recognizes Moongold, which has fancy writing. They are known as crafters of art with martial artistry through weapon innovation. Use “moongold” , an unknown substance in their weapons.

The party heads to the engine car of the Iron Smoker. Cello looks to see if They can release their cart from the main engine cart to slow it down. And asks if there is anyone strong enough to remove the attachment. Durzoga states “I would be happy to help with that.” With the minimal help of Cello, Durzoga removes the railroad spike and their cart begins to slow down. “Thank the gods that worked.” Durzoga says. “The people in the train station are in for a surprise,” Waron remarks. They see a lumbering scab and pus-covered bandaged man with a chain looking from the train cart speeding away. He swings his chained grappling hook. Waron manages to deflect the chained attack as the engine room speeds away. Something humanoid and spectral flaps out of the top of the room. There is a crownlike antler visage with empty black fabric like a covered face. Narissa recognizes from a monster compendium toam she read long ago. In the section around Unknown Knoll “possible Wendigo.:” It stated that people should pray that they never come across it. Its name was “The horned hunter”. Cello recalls a creature that was a Yeager that seems to watch over Luyanhra from a distance. Celled the “Veiled Hunter.” Narissa raises her gun but immediately hears the voice of her uncle saying her name as he died. Her hand with her gun begins to shake as she is gripped with fear.

“Well I’ll be. I think detaching was the best way to do this.” Waron says as he looks around from a way to send a signal. .Grey suggests that they jump off the roof and he gets up on the roof. Narissa looks for magnesium and goes with Waron to find a flare. Break in case of emergency. Waron breaks it with a mace and they grab the flares, a blanket and Marinus’s bottle of liquor. Narizza asks Durzoga if she can throw the container of hard alcohol, magnesium and gunpowder . Waron gives Marinus a bottle of whiskey before Narissa shoots the tossed concoction. The flare explodes and some of the party are momentarily blinded and pushed back. Flood lights brighten suddenly around Luharnya and the defense system triggers as the run away train cart continues towards Luharnya. Despite the canons, the cart crashes . A voice calls from a Yeagermaesters because there is a breach . The flood lights turn their cart . Greay attempts to detach another spike from the cart to slow them down. The rest of the party begins to move to the back of the cart. Grey detached it and the party tries to jump to the next train. Grey and Narissa land in a perfect barrel roll stance. The rest of the party land on them. Cello gets caught on the tracks just a Dur'zoga pulls them out of the way,

A massive explosion occurs from the rest of the box cart as the cannons blow apart the train cart. Shrapnel rains down upon them. Durzhoga gets hit in the stomach and falls unconscious. “Oh for fuck’s sake I’ll put her out of her misery.” Narissa shoots Durzhga in the head with a healing rosary bullet. Cello hugs Durzohga. “I thought you were gonna finish her off. You’ve gotta warn us about that next time.” Waron says. “There wasn’t any time she was dying.” Narissa shrugs. They hear another yell from the guards that they are going to destroy the remaining carts as they believe it is a domestic attack. Marinus grabs another bottle as they move to the next cart. Cello and Waron help Duzoga to the stairs. Narissa grabs a black bottle of licorice wine. Marinus grabs peppermint barbary brandy . Durzhga jumps off the train with Cello and Waron. Marinus tries to void levitate out of the train. Grey and Daul jump. As does Narissa and Waron. Grey and Waron fall unconscious after they land. Daul stabilizes Grey as Narissa attempts to help Dur’zoga stabilize Waron. Suddenly, four big beasts come around them from the dark. Lion head with a beast like massive body. Marinus and Virena run. Cello begs Dur’zoga to pick up Waron. Everyone runs to the hole in the wall that leads to Luyarnha . A large explosion is triggered as the beasts move. They seem to try and tunnel but hit landmines. They manage to get through the wall Creepy shattered moon? The city is silent “bone quiet.” but they hear a melancholic lullaby in the distance. Grey and Waron wake up and everyone LEVELS UP.
