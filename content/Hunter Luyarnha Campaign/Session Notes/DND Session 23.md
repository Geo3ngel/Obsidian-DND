## Bits
#### Werewolves coming
Look for the book "Werewolves coming" by Narissa's recommendation.
- Ah yes, my dear friend Narissa Shaw recommended me a novel with a Werewolves cover.
	- I think it was some kind of bestiary?
	- Oh, and would you happen to have one with alligators in it?
- Expecting it to be some form of bestiary
- Wants to know if there are any, but that include alligators
#### Payment technique
Waron putting a random fist full of gold on the table and asking
a party member if the number is right
- Use a d1000 to get the number
#### Bath time?
I feel like this might be brought up somewhere...
## Things to Address
### Shopping
Don't forget about that Scythe I asked the Vicor for!
- Soul sucking **Scythe** promised by the Vicor from I.I.I.I
Components for making **holy water**
- **Silvered powder**? (Is this consumed?)
	- If yes, and holy water is the same price, no sense in wasting my time and spell slots.
- **Water flasks**

Waron would also want to visit the sanctified sinner to chat about his whole blood situation
- see about getting me those 4hp back!
	- "Hey, uh, can you undo that thing you did to me? Seems to have some pretty nasty side effects."
- Maybe prod some more about the vial of reborn blood?
### Plot wise?
Jaeger Meister Calvin, avoided the curse of the Veiled hunter by clawing out his own eyes
- assists Greisha in Paterna Iter.

Seek out Vicor Orestopholies
- A construct, like Cello, devout to faith.
- provided housing for the group

Connection with some ember heart in the Sanctified district as well
- Mr. Local legend?

Crafting bits from Cleric beast parts!

## Money!
We got $7kish, but didn't split it?

# Session Notes
---

## Pre-sleep
### Narissa
Checks in on
### Marinus
Visits the clinic to get more tonic, but finds an emergency room filled to the brim
- Notes that the Paladins didn't do well walling off last night during the hunt
Organ harvesting from monsters???

Marinus uses Waron's name when claiming to be a member of the Blood Cross
- He gets interrogated for being suss af.
- "Who are you and how did you get into this city...?"

[[Niemy]], or whatever her name is, is apparently rumored to be working on a cure for the scourge.
- straight to the punch works with her
- Likes flowers
- Marinus got this info from: **[[Bloody Henry]]**
## Waron
Looks for Geiger on the way back to the barracks
Apparently the two I saved on the first eldritch moon are showing promise as recruits!
- Waron should keep an eye out for the guy, seems like he's become quite the fan of Waron.
	- He's ended up pranked a few times due to Waron just wearing armor all the time.
## While Asleep
#### Cello
Cello has a dream of her and Minerva.
Minerva has a nervous breakdown of her searching for something
- it ends up being a gun
The performance is that of a story of a Man gradually consumed by the scourge, only abated by the ballad of the moonlit princess.
- the moonlit princess isn't a completed song/story
## Marinus 
hung upside down in the void again
## Waron
Some form of celebration?
Some guy with a pony tail?
- Paladin? Armor?
- We've been working together as private security
- Is this Waron's wedding
	- Yes. Yes it is.

Ludwig!?
- Apparently was broskies w/ Ludwig.
- Pact to keep this city safe, as a business?
	- With ME leading the helm!
Leah, aka Waron's wife

Fades out, peaceful. Hopeful.
## Narissa
Seems to talk with her mom in her sleep?

---
9 months worth of beheadings in the sanctified district...
- likely culprits being the circle.
- Occurring since the 33rd hunt.
	- Lines up with Vicor Pricilla's death?
---
The church gave us bad coin

Waron puts his whole purse into his mouth to bite test for bad peices.
10 gold broken dust pieces
60 gold was fake total for Waron's purse.
- had a bitter taste to it?
Waron buys the following for (450g)
![[Pasted image 20240601225623.png]]
- how much damage does this do at it's base though? (d10?)
- What is it's reach? Is it similar to the [[Church Pick]] in that its reduced in it's untransformed state?
Ends up losing 520g, as 60 is fake, and he breaks 10 testing the rest.

High apostle Novella sponsors the sanctified sinner
- Novella is somewhat like me, yes?
The blood thing is Pruning process for Jaegers!?
WE got the Warranty!

When you took that vial, something went with it. A memory, of someone I must not forget. But it's strange... I can't quite recall her face or name... But she's... warm.
- I'm sorry to ask this, but can you.. give it back?
	- I can compensate you for the trouble, and if it's possible to get my blood back from last time as well...
I recall a sentence: I want 
I will find every one I know and love dead  if I leak this info:
- Some people speak of this curse, my "hunger"
	- The abyss wardens
	- In the shrouded district
Apparently Waron has died? This guy leaked this to Waron.
Waron wouldn't want to put the rest of his party in danger by telling them about the abyss Wardens, but would insist on needing to go to the shrouded district.
- He would tell Narissa about the blood bit, and mention his strange curse... but also warn her of the dangers of investigating it further
	- Would draw Marinus in for potentially investigating this bit further as well...
# Follow up w/ Narissa next Session
The shop keep at the Sanctified sinner when doing the procedure on Waron, had quite a lot to say...
- Waron has another curse. Not just the Scourge.
	- This would be an opportune moment for Waron to reveille himself as a scourgeborne to Narissa
		- Remove his helmet
Mention the desire to travel to the shrouded district to search for some group known as "The abyss wardens".
- For they may have knowledge of my curse...
- They harbor knowledge of something "great, dark, and deep".
According to [shop keep name], the scourge corrupts. But this curse is one of hunger, not mere corruption. 
- The abyss Wardens know something of my curse.

He claims that these services (treatments) can save me... though he will not act without my consent.
- Prior to this though, he mentioned wanting to make Waron "Perfect".
- Waron responded: "But I don't want to be perfect. I *want* to be Waron."
> [!info] Waron's decision
> Waron seeks further understanding of his curse/predicament before he's willing to continue with these procedures...
> - I should also seek out high apostle [[Nevallah]]
> So he walked out mid-procedure after having his blood drawn.
> - Some aspect of "Her" left him.
> 	- Just what are they doing though with his blood...?
> 		- They seemed to find some value in it after all...


Waron rejoins the party, visibly shaken, even through his armor
- he's tremoring lightly.
