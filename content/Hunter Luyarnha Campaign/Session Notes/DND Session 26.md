## Potential bits to do?

Waron bits:
Now, listen. There are some things people are better off not knowing.
Sometimes, people change against their will, and are afraid of how others will perceive them.

### Waron rolls for lucidity momentarily on his "situation"

I don't know exactly how or why, but I get this... feeling. Like I've lost some critical part of myself. 

Somewhere, deep down, I know I wasn't always like this. It's... terrifying. I don't know if I have, err, had any loved ones in truth. 

But, if I did, I truly don't believe they'd accept what it is that I've become. 
There's this insatiable gut wrenching feeling, like anyone who sees me will reject me outright. Much like you, after getting a glimpses under my helm the other day.

Folks who catch a glimpse seem to always be driven away... Don't know why, even other members of the hunt don't get the same treatment. It's weird, you know?



"Where's Narissa?" 
"Idk, she just sort of stormed off after I kept refusing to strip (my armor off)"

Eh bit:
I'm a monster. Horrible, wretched. The hunger that threatens to overtake my mind at times is held back by a fucking thread, alright? I try to stay positive, keep it at bay, but the voice... voices? Never let me forget that I've forgotten.

## Waron's Dream
Leiah talking with Ludwig, upset at him.
My name, Gerard.

Waron learns he was the leader of the eldritch hunt
The abyss wardens apparently only reported to Waron...
- Saying I, knew what I was doing...?

Waron's going to either want to see Ludwig, or seek out Narissa, claiming he can actually answer some of the questions she had last night now.

Leiah manages to calm Waron's outburst, by gently telling him to "Find the moon".
## Dur'zoga's dream
Her father speaks of the Godless King's take over of the city being the reason their family left.
The Godless King was felled, and the Radiant Church took over the city.
From one Tyrant to another.

Their bloodline apparently stems from the Ruby district, and with the new management (The radiant church), they are under quarantine for their "tainted essence".

## The Sanctified district
Narissa runs into some bread salesman, pickpocketing some bread, and being given a warning about being in the sights of Lucky Lenny, Dur'zoga having a target on her back for crossing the Way-farers
- Told her to stay away from the [[Waterfront District]]
