# Session Intro
---
Still shopping!
Waron's got his new Scythe!
- [ ] Add Scythe to inventory
I did buy some silver powder, though think I need some vials of water to make holy water for Narissa!
> [!question] Is silver powder consumed during ceremony?

Verena stuff w/ Marinus's whole situation

# Session Notes
---
Ruby district seems to be the area where scourge folk are locked off

Waron's still very shaken up
- Trembling slightly

He did something to me
I had a vision, of who I'm not sure. but I'm certain it's someone I mustn't forget.
- I felt a *piece* of them leave me

I stopped mid procedure...
- he removed something from me, but didn't inject me with the thing he did afterwards like last time.

Waron has another curse. Not just the Scourge.
	- This would be an opportune moment for Waron to reveille himself as a scourgeborne to Narissa
		- Remove his helmet
Mention the desire to travel to the ***[[shrouded district]]*** to search for some group known as "The abyss wardens".
- For they may have knowledge of my curse...
- They harbor knowledge of something "great, dark, and deep".
According to [shop keep name], the scourge corrupts. But this curse is one of hunger, not mere corruption. 
- The abyss Wardens know something of my curse.

He claims that these services (treatments) can save me... though he will not act without my consent.
- Prior to this though, he mentioned wanting to make Waron "Perfect".
- Waron responded: "But I don't want to be perfect. I *want* to be Waron."

**Note**: Thank Cello on behalf of her mistress for the bath

Waron's lower face was revieled

Oh right! I mentioned to Verena that I'd like to talk with her about what she saw in my mind

Waron's the closest thing to a puppy Cello will get

Carmella for memory
