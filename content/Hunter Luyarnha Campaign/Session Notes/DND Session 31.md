# Session Intro
---
We start off in combat, Initiative pointing towards Grey's turn...
Facing a foe on the lower level against a foe with a melted wax head?
# Session Notes
---
Cello Bardically inspires Waron, and casts Cure wounds on Verena
[[Narissa]] is administered the silver tonic, and rolls a nat 1, gaining permanent madness
The ultimate truth is reveled to her... 
- There is purpose in these moons, in this madness
- Any and all saving throws against madness are at disadvantage (For Narissa)
Dur'zoga also seems to fail a madness roll


10 enemies died to the gears on the way down.
- 21 more to go!
