# Session Notes
---
Cello Bardically inspires Waron, and casts Cure wounds on Verena
[[Narissa]] is administered the silver tonic, and rolls a nat 1, gaining permanent madness
The ultimate truth is reveled to her... 
- There is purpose in these moons, in this madness
- Any and all saving throws against madness are at disadvantage (For Narissa)
Dur'zoga also seems to fail a madness roll

 **Rush of memories that are not their own from the creature - Marinus early on. Then Verena. The being sensed cello casting a healing spell. Verena casts daylight. Frightening the remaining skurge creatures away. 

Narissa goes down after trying to face the beast alone. Marinus heals Bloody Henry and traps the creature in a black hole. Warren heals Narissa.. Surrounding the creature, and with the creature’s poor decision making, Warren, Marinus, Cello and Verena simultaneously attack the beast and slay it. 

  

Confusing twisting maze, 3D. She falls upwards, “the ultimate truth reveals itself to you' she sees a man. Man has putrescent golden horns breaking through his skin, which looks like melded flesh put together. Long term madness.  The man has a claddend belt with a hain. The chain holds books, each book with a knife sigil glowing on each cover. A green putrid energy seems to come from his chest. Narissa understands the knowledge and splendor that this man has made her believe that there is reason and purpose to these hunts. There is a purpose to all of this. 

AnY AND ALL SAVING THROWS FOR MADNESS ARE AT DISADVANTAGE - FOR NARISSA. 

Narissa awakens, not seeing the beast and her vision. Instead Marinus is helping her sit up saying that he’s got her. He demands to know where the beast she saw went, but he insists there is nothing. He offers her some more silver tonic, but she hears whispers coming from it and she refuses, stammering about what she saw. 

  

A heavy ping sounds across the room and area/ There is a howl and a sound of crunching gears and wood. The party moves through the cave and as Dur’zhoga goes ahead, she seems to see something, triggering a freezing bout of madness for her. Verena goes to Durzhoga to try and break her out of her madness. Verena bows her head against Durzhoga’s and her tattoo’s begin to glow as her hair glows. Warren instructs the group to protect Verena and Durzhoga. Warren hears the hoard from outside 

Cello trick hat - bunnies to be a distraction. 

Narissa holds her action to shoot any enemies that come within 30ft that do no follow the bunny distraction. Marinus creates a barrier of oil in front of Narissa and marinus Narissa gets an idea to make Marinus some oil leaking boots for his socks. 

  

A massive man with a brick in one hand and heavily burdened with skurge. Half possessed and seemingly stretched from the inside by a beast , former luyarnha’ins.**

10 enemies died to the gears on the way down.
- 21 more to go!
