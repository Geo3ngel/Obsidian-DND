Some of the party members have some sort of hyper realistic dream. Narissa dreams of the moment her eldest brother, Killian, is made a full monster hunter and is given Nightbringer. However, at the end she sees a wendigo in fog that croaks “memories.” Verena dreams about the day she was burned in a demonstration duel by Prescott casting FireBall. Marinus dreams of a case where there was a burned victim.

Grinding sounds like chalk on a white board outside wakes them up, however they didn’t gain the benefit of a long rest, just a short rest. Sleeping through an Eldritch Moon you can only gain the benefits of a short rest.Weird shimmering shards of light rain down through the air and pass through them. Narissa and Daul realize it's the same as the eldritch moon above. Suddenly, a Lycan tears open the metal sheath. It appears as a wolf-like creature with matted and bloodied fur as well as a sickly demeanor. There are also some ghosts behind it. Ghostly singing lady (Giest) appears in a human form along with her ghosts (geist parasites). The Geist woman appears to pop between corporeal and physical forms. When one of them die, they seem to release a death burst.

While Hugo is distracted, Narissa steals 6 pure silver bullets. Waron goes unconscious after battling the Lycan and Cello puppet controls Daul to get to Waron. Narissa kills the wolf, it howls out and two more appear. People descend from the sky. Nude half orc lady descends from the sky and kills the wolf, smashing it to a pulp. Her body is covered in the viscera of the wolves she just killed.
