# Session Intro
## Hugo Doki-Doki Filler Episode
---
In the luminary Repository. (Late/mid afternoon)
- Currently still searching for information on the Circle of Symbiosis.
- Rhanya Pelecos has more information in her archives/studies which may contain info on the circle.
	- Though that information comes at a cost. 
	- She needs us to investigate the Shrouded district's scourge break outs from the silver tonics

# Session Notes
---
We enter the shrouded district
The Jaeger workshop is near the entrance here?
- Contains a master forger/weapons smith, known as Gerum
	- Paralyzed from the waste down
	- Has an automaton assistant
We shenanigans our way through a window, with the assistance of an old man with a bandaged set of eyes

Cello esc mannequin?
- Named Dolly, everyone just calls her "The Doll"
- The servant of Gerum presumably?
- Seems that weapon makers seem to have some connections to Verena's family

Gerum is the guy who crafts stuff from beast parts!

## Vising Hugo
The gang visits Hugo, and Cello hands him a pinacolato. 

Verena is royalty apparently?
- or just fucking with Hugo more lol

## Dur'zoga finds a drug deal
She goes solo to explore around
Dur'zoga encounters an apparent drug deal gone wrong.
- The dealer's stash was stolen by the victim
- He's being attacked by them, as he's failed to pay his debts
The dealer? (presumably) has a whistle resembling the sound of a sea shanty?
They seem to be sailors.
Dur'zoga SMASH
- -es one into the ground.
Known as "The wayfairers"
- Claims [[Lenny]] is going to have her head for even touching them.
