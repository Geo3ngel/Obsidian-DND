One of the main areas in the [[Luyarnha]].

# Description

The Waterfront district once functioned as the pulsing artery of the city, the hub of docks and seafaring vessels that skimmed the river, creating a conduit for trade and external communication.

The district was once a thriving medley of sailors, traders, and cloak-and-dagger operatives â€”each striving to carve out an existence within the tumultuous Luyarnha. 

Yet, in the wake of the city's blockade brought about by the Scourge, swathes of the district have succumbed to deterioration, at times projecting an eerie semblance of a ghost town. 

The once vibrant streets now lie desolate, a chilling silence replacing the hustle and bustle. 

The crisp river breeze, once a welcome respite on the sweltering plazas, now only instills shivers in the hearts of the few who dare to tread these deserted streets.
