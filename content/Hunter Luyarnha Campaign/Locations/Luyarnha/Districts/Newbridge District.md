One of the main areas in the [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Locations/Luyarnha/Luyarnha]].

# Description

Formerly known as the Spired District, the area was a bustling residential hub of Luyarnha. 

The First War, however, was not kind to the district. It bore the brunt of the conflict, its proximity to the frontline turning it into a primary target for enemy onslaughts. 

The district was brutally ravaged, its once proud spires crumbled to dust. Yet, resilience sparked amidst the ruins. Over the last four decades, the district has risen from its ashes, thanks in large part to the Scions. 

They established their headquarters within the last surviving spire, a wonder of gothic architecture, igniting a transformation from that solitary point. 

It is the district's crowning jewel, the Scions Fortress.
