One of the main areas in the [[Luyarnha]].

# Description

In the midst of the sprawling metropolis of Luyarnha, the Sanctified District stands as embodied proof of the city's renaissance. 

Its opulent architecture unfurls as a resplendent spectacle that weaves a tale of the city's illustrious growth, reflected in daunting spires reaching for the heavens, magnificent edifices bearing centuries of stories, and labyrinthine cobblestone paths, meticulously assembled to form an artistic mosaic underfoot. 

A verdant enclave of beauty and tranquility, this regal domain is veiled from the chaotic thrum of the city's core, bounded by the **Moryanne River** to the south and fortified by a castle to the east. Lush gardens, flourishing with an array of plants, cradle the district, crafting an Eden-like sanctuary that contrasts starkly with the teeming corruption sprawling within its walls. 

It is more than just a district; it is an exemplar of grandeur corroded by time, a fortified, sanctified garden of delights sullied by greed, a golden apple that houses more rot than a mound of corpses.
