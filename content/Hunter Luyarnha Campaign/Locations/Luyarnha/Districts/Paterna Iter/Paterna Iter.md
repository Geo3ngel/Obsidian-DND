# Description

Paterna Iter District, in its stoic majesty, is distinguished by the grand road that seamlessly winds its way to the heart of the city, holding the Grand Cathedral. 

Once a hallowed path for the devotees of various faiths, it offered sanctuary and a place for penitence and prayers. 

This ancestral trail of unity and valor, hence named Paterna Iter, paid homage to the brave ones who dared to wrestle Luyarnha into a semblance of unity during its nascent, tremulous era.

Furthermore, it symbolizes the bygone era when the city's streets, particularly this one, were throbbing with life and visitors. 

Foreigners would arrive, whether by carriage or locomotive, and the Paterna Iter would unfurl before them, inviting exploration of the city. The road once echoed with the shuffling of the ill, seeking the mythical Holy Tonic of the Radiant Church.

Today, though the lines have dissipated, those in desperate need of a cure stealthily smuggle themselves across the city's threshold, evading the well-trodden paths and resorting to illicit means.
