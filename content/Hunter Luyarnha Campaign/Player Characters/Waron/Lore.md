Wife's name: Leiah
Curse(s)
- Scourge Borne
- Some other... kind of curse? "The Hunger", as it's known of in the shadow district.

## His appearance
Deflect to the fact that other members of the eldritch hunt are also scourge borne?
- Some folk fear us for it. Can't say I blame them, what with all the scourge has done to the city and all...
- We try our best to keep each other in line, focused on the unified goal of protecting the city we once proudly called our home, as normal, decent men and woman.

# Notes of import
Waron didn't panic/have an attack when Waron had a bit of his helmet removed
by Narissa in the baths
- works for why he didn't panic/have an attack similar to the dream sequence the other day
# Leads to pursue
Carmella for memory stuff!
- also has connections with Cello's mistress!
- In the Ruby district!
