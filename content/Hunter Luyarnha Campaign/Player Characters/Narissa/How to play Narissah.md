## Intro
In the event that Alessa can't make it to session, this document is meant to serve as a loose guide on how to play her character (in combat)

## Combat Action Questions
Which gun is in which hand?
	- does this effect action vs bonus action usage?
Is the bullet fired in order of where they are loaded in the barrel?
	- or can I choose any in the barrel?
How  many grit points does she have?
- I think she can only have 1 at a time, right?
- So if she already has one, she can't get a 2nd from rolling a nat 20 on a firearm attack
	- Or killing a `significant threat`
## Potential Synergies
Expending a grit point to use forceful shot to try and push an enemy 15ft when it's within attacking range of multiple party members, so they can use their reactions to make an attack of opportunity as it leaves their range!
## Recovery Options
### Once per short rest
Can expend a **bonus action** to use `Second Wind`, which heals for 1d10 + 4HP
- she can also action surge to allow an additional action per turn
