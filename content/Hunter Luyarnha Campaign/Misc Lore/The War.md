It seems as though Luyarnha was embroiled war with beast from the east/south?

Beast waves from the SOUTH?

- Prior war 15 year ago
- Ended after 10 years
- Jaeger Meisters came out of this warâ€¦
	- No new ones have been made since the end of the war 5 years ago.
	- Though the Jaeger program still seems to be alive an well?
