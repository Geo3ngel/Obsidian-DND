# Notes
He revived Marinus after he was team killed by possessed [[Semetra]].
- Only after initially refusing to revive him, due to Marinus's `tainted soul`
- Paridous was alluded to owe some form of debt to Semetra?

**Will no longer revive [[Marinus]]**
- Seems to believe Marinus is some harbinger of death and destruction.
