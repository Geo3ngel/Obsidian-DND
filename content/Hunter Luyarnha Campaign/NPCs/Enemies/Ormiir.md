### Current Status:
Deceased. Killed by [[Semetra]] in her Possessed form during our initial encounter.
### Species:
Some kind of Lichen[needs spelling check] (possibly wendigo variant?)
#### Organizational affiliations:
Member of "[[The Circle of Symbiosis]]"

#### Plot relevance:
Encountered within the tree stride portal in the main tree in the garden in the [[Sanctified District]]
Known within "[[The Circle of Symbiosis]]" as their **Dullahan summoner**.

Seems to be tasked with summoning Dullahan for the purpose of gathering more members for their organization to assimilate in the form of severed heads.

> [!info] Hints at Cello's master's assailant likely being a member of the same organization.
