### Species:
Some kind of Lichen[needs spelling check] (possibly wendigo variant?)
#### Organizational affiliations:
Member of "[[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Organizations/The Circle of Symbiosis]]"

#### Plot relevance:
Encountered within the tree stride portal in the main tree in the garden in the [[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Locations/Luyarnha/Districts/Sanctified District]]
Known within "[[content/Hunter Luyarnha Campaign/Organizations/The Circle of Symbiosis]]" as their **Dullahan summoner**.

Seems to be tasked with summoning Dullahan for the purpose of gathering more members for their organization to assimilate in the form of severed heads.

> [!info] Hints at Cello's master's assailant likely being a member of the same organization.
