**District of residence**: [[Paterna Iter]]
A somewhat young looking but gruff acting man with soot on his face 
## Hugo's breakdown
Real name: Hubert Magmabrant
Real Age 26

The party kind of breaks him in [[DND Session 21]]
Vanessa decides to fuck with his heart strings, and ends up snapping a few.
He has a total breakdown, and ends up trauma dumping, and opening up about everything from the loss of his parents, to the fa√ßade he's gone through painstaking efforts over the years to *maintain*
- Though the hunter with us asserts that no one *actually* bought it, but humored him for years.
