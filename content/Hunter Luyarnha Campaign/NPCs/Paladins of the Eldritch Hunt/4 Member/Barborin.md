# Notes:
I encountered them in [[Session 10]], when making my way to meet my party members for heading to the Sanctified district.

He seemed to be covered in blood, gruff, somewhat rude initially. Made a comment about monsters seeming to be getting bigger lately.
- Seemed to imply he was fighting a monster in the water ways that was getting bigger no matter how much he cut them down.
- So naturally Waron recommended him a bigger Axe for cutting down bigger monsters 
	- He liked that. A lot lmao.
