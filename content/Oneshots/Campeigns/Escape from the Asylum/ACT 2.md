# Situation
---
Post TPK, Nisovin's been thrown a bone by Nisovin Prime to form a crew to do crime and create chaos.
- Basically, the ultimate goal is to tear down the system or something vague like that. Basically, we're agents of Chaos.
Nisovin's reset to a point back in time, but things are somewhat... different.

Everyone seems somewhat... complacent. Happy even. Disgusting, this cannot stand!

## How to *Corrupt* the rest of the party?
- hypnotism?
- Poison?
- Do little things that cause them harm and blame it on the orderlies?
	- Convince these mentally ill folk that the red cross is somehow conspiring against them, or trying to harm them

## Bits to cause chaos:
"Don't trust the water! They've put chemicals in it to get you to believe them"

Try to convince Gertrude that Edgar is kidnapped, and needs help!
- or is being kept away by the orderlies!
- "How's Edgar doing these days? Have the orderlies still been keeping him away? [Shifting eyes]"
"I suspect subterfuge afoot... probably the doing of a rouge wizard of some sort!"
- blaming the silver tonic on some unknown rouge wizard threat.
OOooh!
I can use this!
"I AM AN ELDRITCH GAWD, MADE FLESH! YOU CANNOT CONTAIN MY MORTAL COIL IN ANY WAY THAT MATTERS!"
- as he ascends into the air
"Listen, Vicor Hickory..."
- I'd like to inquire to the where about of our dearest friend, Edgar. Gertrude's beloved husband of many years."
"So you're saying we're your lab"
#### Experimental Elixir

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce up to 1 experimental elixir(s), each in an empty flask you touch. Roll for each elixir’s effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.
- I made an elixir of flight!

## Questioning bits
"What's todays date?"

Nisovin went balls to the walls mode, and catapulted his hammer at the Vicor to try and smash them through a window.
- He succeeded.
- Then some 'creature' speeds up the tower, climbing at an incredible pace, and rolls 28 to hit him. (3 attacks in 1 action btw)
- The Vicor was some demonic creator "Acting" this entire time...
	- It's definitely going to be another TPK.

If I do survive, and we all survive... or if we get another chance at this w/ Nisovin's knowledge...
	- Wand of secrets in the Vicor's office!

## For Next Session:
Avoid the Vicor at all costs.
- Would he even put together that the Vicor was that monster? He was KO'd pretty fast...
- He knows the tonics are poisoned with some demonic shit now for certain...
### Other
Chet, dream lilies!
- drugs used to escape reality for a bit
- Use these to poison the orderlies!
- If I need to threaten him, threaten the following:
	- "This time I'll be sure to scoop out BOTH your eyes!"

Oh... Oh no.. I, uh, don't feel so good- pukes ray of sickness
- could use this bit as a distraction, or to get my way to the infirmary

There are mines/mineshafts in this region... how can I take advantage of that?

Nisovin knows about [[Khad]]'s gay lover locket.
- He can call him out for it, or say that he knows about it to freak him out/black mail him!

Soan's been buying drugs from their red headed contact to calm them down/help them escape mentally.
### Ideas for next session:
Maybe rather than escaping, we can mount a coup?
- Take over the place, become the orderlies?
- Lock up some group of orderlies to hold hostage?
- Trap one, and torture them for information about the silver tonics being corrupted
	- Nisovin's investigating the Vicor after what happened last time
Or Nisovin could intro like he's been trapped in this time loop for Eons, and the things he's learned have driven him even more mad
- "You think I'M the monster here? [Maddening laughter], *Oooh* you poor souls. You really have no idea do you?"
- "What gives you the moral right to call me a monster? I know *allll* about you missy!" Start quoting off things I know from previous iterations about everyone in the room.
