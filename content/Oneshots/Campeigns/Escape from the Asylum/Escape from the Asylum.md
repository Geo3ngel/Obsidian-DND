# Summary
---
This is a meme one shot we conceptualized in one of the DND Sessions in [[Hunter's - Steinhardt's guide to the eldritch hunt DND campaign]] based on Alessa's backup character, [[Gertrude]].

Since she's portrayed as a crazy old bat that can see the ghost of her husband, it naturally followed that she could have escaped from a local [[Luyarnha]] insane asylum.

And thus this to-be-cluster-fuck of a campaign was born!

The idea being we all play as a bunch of old/crazy folk that want to break out of the asylum. What could go wrong?
