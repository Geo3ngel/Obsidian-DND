Ah heyyyy~ David, my main Man!
- he's just gonna keep getting his name wrong

"That jerk had it coming!
Trying to pass off that poison as *food*, guh!"

"Vih Chor whatsit" STILL hasn't read my last appeal?!

## Experimental Elixier
I can make one of these for free at dawn each day!
- Roll from a table for these!

## Spells:

# Arcane Infusions
### Homunculus Servant
I need to somehow get my hands on a gem worth minimum 100gp, so I can make myself a butler, or RAT friend!
- RAT friend would be ballin'
### Mind Sharpener
- I might want to replace this one...
- if they fail a con save, they can use their reaction to auto succeed!
### Replicate Magic Item:
Rope of Climbing!
Wand of Secrets

### Food bits to plan escape:
Pick out bones from the Rotisserie Chicken!

### Other PC's Name:
Luflan (Chell)
Saon (Duncan)
Hephzibah Quilldon (Ari?)
Gertrude Rickette (Alessa)

### Get Hephzibah some 'Reagents'?

Local gang: "Scavenger"

So you're telling me I'm perfectly safe to walk these streets? Well then, why are you still keeping us all tied up here?
I have work to do! Rouge Wizards to apprehend! Important work I assure you!


I didn't even have to use my bones!

Sneak up and threaten Chet Dooley to spill the info we need

I want to make a mechanical RAT as my Golem
R47! RAT!

Never mind, a RAT killed me in 1 hit instead...
- would have lived downed if I healed myself instead of the enemy for memes

# FOR NEXT TIME!

Nisovin knows now about Ari's character's shotgun

Oooh! Next time, I want to have Nisovin make a Mechanical R47, and have it negotiate with the Sewer Rats to assist us in our escape.
- I'll need to find something worth 100gp again...
	- I no longer have the necklace from that brat on me!
Nisovin's reset in the time loop, back to when they where being served their food!
But things seem... different. Everyone is actually eating there's and seem... orderly. ew.
I'll have to fit that!
- Sabotage their meals, or find some way to break them out of their trances, and plan an escape!
- I have Artificer abilities than can be used to send secret messages and the like! These could be super useful to do secret stuff between party members

## Bits
You make me want to kickstart a landmine

Nisovin bit:
During WW1 (Wizard War 1) they used the term "Spellshock" to describe the condition of Wizards that had been particularly mentally affected by battle, it was by the middle of  WW2 they started to use the acronym PTSD (Post Traumatic Spell Disorder)

We'll become like a pair of pearl fish and oyster. Even in death, we shall not part.

I love the dichotomy of innocents that got locked up here, and Nisovin who clearly belongs here.
