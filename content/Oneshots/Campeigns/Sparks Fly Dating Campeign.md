# Prep 
I need to build a level 7 Artificer!
I'm thinking of making some kind of Charisma Artificer build, rather than an intelligence based one?

This would imply they tinker more so based on instinct, rather than training. An "Artist" so to say.
- More Artist than artisan
- Focuses on aesthetics? Nah, maybe junks stuff together that barely works, but passes as a PoC (Common critic that their pieces lack refinement)
That, or a an 

## Bits
Dating SFX Soundboard at the ready!
Cast Arcane eye for some shenanigans?
Hello! Yes, I am Bargus, this is my little flame friend, Calcifer!

Background
## Subclass
**Options**: Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist or Battle Smith

### Race: 
Probably Gnome? (+2 Int +1 Dex)
- I want Int & Wisdom eideally.
- Also gives the Tinkerer bit, so I can make a clock work toy that needs constant repair!

I'm pretty sure I need Hunter to enable content sharing and the campaign character sheet to allow us to create a character with Artificer stuff without buying DND Beyond specific bits

Ooooh, I could do a bit with *disguise* as a spell!
- actually an undercover cop or some shit?\

## Character Concept

Gentle Giant with a passion for making tiny springy steampunk looking creatures
- 10 million steam punk fire flies
- OOOH, or a druid/artificer multiclass build of some sort?
	- He makes artificial limb replacements for Flora and Fauna
- to do this, I'd need Wisdom 13, and Int 13.
	- I'd be effectively building him out as a healer.
Wouldn't that technically be an Armorer subclass?
- Nature Cleric subclass?
	- heavy armor proficiency!
	- think of the wildshape potential!
		- And speak with animals/familiar stuff!
		- Can I have an army of semi-mechanical familiars?! (HOLY SHIT, THIS IS EGGMAN FROM SONIC!)
		- Homunculus servant infusion!? (servant can deliver touch spells like Cure wounds)
	Druid subclass: Circle of stars/circle of the moon?

He loves embedding stunning jewels into his creations, to give the creatures/insects/prosthetics their own unique sheen/style/luster.

## Shameful secret?
He has something in his past, relating to his old home life that's the real reason he doesn't like the idea of going home...
- Nothing to bad or crazy, just super embarrassing

Soothing creative minds/mending broken hearts!

Little flame spirit, Calcifer over his shoulder.
Little glowing lights behind him, which are actually mechanical steam punk esc bugs following him.

Anything you do with your spare time for... fun?
How do you feel about 
## Robot pickup lines

- Were you designed for use on Mars? Because your chassis is out of this world!

- Would you allow me through your firewall?
