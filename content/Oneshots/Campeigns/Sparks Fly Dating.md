My Final Score for this Smith would be:


# Questions for conversations:
Sooo, what's your primary function?
Aaaand your secondary function? Like what do you do for fun? What are you all about?

### What I do:
I love tinkering with nature, especially making little clockwork bugs and such! Insects are such fascinating creatures, how they fit into nature is really something, you know?

In my spare time, I like to make prosthetics for injured forest creatures.
- You know, someone's gotta speak for the trees, the bees, and all that.

#### I specialize in insect rehabilitation:
There was this grove of fire flies this one time that had a clash with a local mosquito swarm, leaving many of them unable to fly with damaged wings.
## Bits:
Ask Calcifer if I should go for it off the bat or not.

End up summoning a familiar to spy on L0v3, to try and get a better idea of how to approach them
- Use Wild Companion to summon some kind of R4T, a mechanical RAT to listen in on the conversation with L0v3
	- Better yet, a Racoon with a clockwork prosthetic named **Rocket**
- Or some kind of mechanical bug? Like a praying mantis, or something?

I need to approach Alek's character, and wild shape into a crocodile for the memes

Cast `Magical Tinkering` To make little static image hearts/animations to communicate across a distant?

## Growth notes:
I didn't get to ask much about her work, I should focus on that more.

Tips from Calcifer?
# Prep for L0v3
Hi there! I'm Bargus, I spent just about all night trying to come up with a way to say this, but I think I love you.

That is a magnificent chassis you have there, how where you created?
Are you on good terms with your creator?

What is it that you're looking for tonight? Love? A partner?

# Next person to approach?
## Alek's Elf
Alek's elf character, attempting to flirt/impress them, turning into a gator

## Eren, the large bodied, tiny goblin head fellow

Cast Thunder wave at the 3rd level to get them all to fuck off of me!
con 16 save, 4 d8 damage!

I will purge you're ilk from the forests, never to interfere with the creatures of this land ever again!
